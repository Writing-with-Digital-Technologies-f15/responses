## SUMMARIES

## How Did We Get Here?

This article gives us the history of html. It starts right at the beginning in 1993 to today with the newest version, which is HTML5. Pilgrim details every tiny bit about html. From the different ways that people have tried to improve it, to the people that have been involved in the entire process. Pilgrim mentions the features of html like MIME types, elements, and tags. In the article MIME type is mentioned a lot. For example, he mentions that there are different MIME types. “Images have their own MIME types, JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, everything has it’s own MIME type.” This particular part was very interesting because not so many people know this.  Also when Pilgrim talks about the MIME types, he goes in detail for the entire process from when web browser requests a page to headers, and finally to the actual page. He talks about other things too. For example, the attempt to form XHTML, which was not very successful, and compatible. The article also mentions the different features that have been added to different versions of HTML that have come up throughout the years to the one we have right now. 

The article was very broad for me. It was almost very overwhelming. I kept learning about different things in each sub heading. All the information provided is important to understand how we got to HTML5, but there is just too much information to absorb at once. I didn’t even understand some of the concepts that Pilgrim talked about. For example, what does he mean by “shipping code wins?” I really didn’t understand this part. 

## HTML & CSS Introduction

This part of the book just explains a few concepts before we dig in to the actual HTML & CSS coding. This part answers the question whether HTML & CSS is hard to learn, which the author states are not. The introduction also explains how the book is structured. It also hints on how people access the web, by showing the process. Lastly, an overview of how the website is created.

I think this introduction is very helpful because it talks about different things that people should understand before they begin learning the actual process of creating web pages. The introduction gives you an understanding of what will happen when you do certain things, which is a crucial part.

## HTML & CSS Chapter 1
 
Chapter 1 gives the general structure for creating a web page. In this chapter we learn about how to begin with a heading <h1>, paragraph <p>, subheadings <h2>, and the body </body>. Duckett explains how to use each of the above. I.e. opening <html> ad ending </html>. In chapter one there are directions on how to create a web page on a PC, and a Mac.  There is also an explanation on tags and how they are used. Overall, the chapter is about showing the reader the importance of structure and how it can be achieved with different techniques.

## HTML & CSS Chapter 4

Chapter 4 mainly explains how to create links between pages, connecting links that go to different pages, and email links. Chapter shows how links are created using <a> element. There is also an explanation on why relative links might be useful than other URLs, and also shows how the relative links can be created.
