I put the file on the website. It's not the most robust of outlines, but I believe it will do. On a sidenote, I am starting to realize how writing on the internet vastly differs from writing a book. The XML talk helped me learn the importance of 'wiki'esque writing. Duckett's book taught me the importance of audience and writing relevant material.

"I'm never going to give you up. I'm never going to let you down. Never going to turn around and desert you" - Rick Astley

A backbone of all literacy technologies has been the ability to write and read. From the oldest of writing technologies, stone tablets, to the technologies of the modern era, twitter and facebook, humans have been using this ability to write and read in order to communicate ideas, concepts and even crack a few jokes. 

These concepts and ideas are incredibely important because they display the thinking of individual writers and how they are beginning to develop ideas and concepts. These concepts are most clearly communicated in the comments of documentation that are found littered throughout history. This article is going to examine the history of documentation in the development in the internet, primarily through the <!-> comment tags. Hopefully, by understanding the devlopment of documentation, we will better understand how past technologies and new technologies are connected, how it developed and why it remains important in the current era. 

To begin connecting past technologies with new technologies, we should look at the development of "protocols, procedures, programs and concepts". In the creation of any useful tool, proper documentation must be utilized. In this way anyone may be able to quickly adopt it. In, "Request For Comments", we are given a snapshot or a glimpse on how the programmers across the US implement this process. They initially communicated through physcial mail, the use of a postal system. However, as the need for feedback became increasingly more pressing, these programmers pivoted and created technologies to communicate. This became the origin point of source code commenting as well the initial concepts to email! 

These programmers knew how important it was to set up this tool well. In the w3.org history, we discover the necessary need to comment properly in source code. The documentation on communicating ideas and concepts became extremely important. To do it improperly, or without care was initially frowned upon. 

However, as time has progressed, rules on documentation has begun to fray at the edges. Anders Abel, writes an article discussing the nature of comment documentation. He discuesses the history of "old legacy code" that creates comment blocks with the revision history of each function as well as old code that has been 'commented' out. In this context, the use of 'commented out' is simply making the original source code inoperable and the new code running in it's place. This is utilized by the same comment command without actually using the tool for its proper purpose. In any case, Abel puts out the opinion that commented out code is a disaster waiting to happen. This is a picture of a tool that was purposed for communication becoming utilized in another way entirely. Ultimately, the use of comment documentation really helps a creator understand the code that they are operating with. It can however become unwieldy, especially when it's not being used properly! 

###Block 2: The use of comments in the modern era. 
We begin to see the nature of comments pervading through our modern technology. While originally intended for cooperation between programmers, it's pivoting in strange and as Haas would say, "cussed" ways. We really get a picture of comments being used for non-purposed means in a brief exchange on stack overflow. Favorited over 4,700 times, this innocous thread simply asked the question, "What is the best comment in source code you have ever encountered." 

The results were amusing and "historically significant". The top rated comment, in source code! was, 

"	I am particularly guilty of this, embedding non-constructive comments, code poetry and little jokes into most of my projects (although I usually have enough sense to remove anything directly offensive before releasing the code). Here's one I'm particulary fond of, placed far, far down a poorly-designed 'God Object':

/**
* For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,
* the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,
* fixing our most awful code. To you, true saviors, kings of men,
* I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
* never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry,
* never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
*/

" 
Jens Roland.

This really does paint the picture of how commenting has changed and continues to change as time progresses. Likewise, we see it begin to pivot in a corporate enviroment as well. Through the Internet Society website, we are given a picture of how code has become more commercialized. The importance of a scalable and accessible website is not something to be marginalized. In fact, "vendors worked extremely hard to ensure that everyone's products interoperated with all the other products - even with those of their competitors." 

There's human greed and joy in source code commenting. It's messy and the format through which it operates is changing in wonderful ways. 

###Block3 Do source code comments evolve? 

Source code comments are comments found in a program, written by the programmer which does not directly affect the program. They are static creations that stand the test of time. However, despite their static nature, the approach to writing source code comments has begun to change. In "Do Code and Comments Co-Evolve?", we are given a glimpse on how open source systems are beginning to change. 

One result that really does strike an interesting point is that "newly added code barely gets commented". While the original author may have the authorial gravitas to enact changes, the open source contributors pivot in an entirely other direction. Source code and the comments within the same program do not seem to evolve. However, source code as a whole does share some intimate relationships with comments. 

In another study, it's clearly stated that, "It is common, especially in large software systems, for developers to change code without updating its associated comments due to their unfamiliarity with the code or due to time constraints." 

Simply put, developers often lack the authorial intent to feel the need or the ability to place comments on source code. It can experience fluctuation based on an a abnormally active developer, but it really does remain static. 

###Block 4. Comment Tools and documentation. 

Commenting needs to evolve. Currently, programmers are starting to see how antiquated systems without comments can become a potential problem. These comments, whether they are outdated or on-existent can confuse or mislead developers in the future.  Therefore, in order to ease the burden on the developers new changes in source code commenting are coming. 

This represents another leap in literacy technology. As opposed to merely reading and writing, code developers are starting to work with audio as well. Max Bluvband, of Maxima Blue Ltd designed a system that enables audio comments "to be used when writing and executing code." While it may not be widely implemented, this make it possible for developers to hear and understand the authorial intent of the original code and develop the code properly for the future. 

Likewise, we see the rise of auto-documentation as well. This, like audio commenting eases the burden on current developers. It describes version control and gives a picture of what the code is intended to do. 

These tools are extremely new and are just another picture of new technologies rising in reaction to old technologies. There are relationships here and they all need to be dug into.
