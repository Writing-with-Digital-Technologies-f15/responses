##Content Tree
I put the file on the website. It's not the most robust of outlines, but I believe it will do. On a sidenote, I am starting to realize how writing on the internet vastly differs from writing a book. The XML talk helped me learn the importance of 'wiki'esque writing. Duckett's book taught me the importance of audience and writing relevant material.

"I'm never going to give you up. I'm never going to let you down. Never going to turn around and desert you" - Rick Astley

A backbone of all literacy technologies has been the ability to write and read. From the oldest of writing technologies, stone tablets, to the technologies of the modern era, twitter and facebook, humans have been using this ability to write and read in order to communicate ideas, concepts and even crack a few jokes. 

These concepts and ideas are incredibely important because they display the thinking of individual writers and how they are beginning to develop ideas and concepts. These concepts are most clearly communicated in the comments of documentation that are found littered throughout history. This article is going to examine the history of documentation in the development in the internet, primarily through the <!-> comment tags. Hopefully, by understanding the devlopment of documentation, we will better understand how past technologies and new technologies are connected, how it developed and why it remains important in the current era. 

To begin connecting past technologies with new technologies, we should look at the development of "protocols, procedures, programs and concepts". In the creation of any useful tool, proper documentation must be utilized. In this way anyone may be able to quickly adopt it. In, "Request For Comments", we are given a snapshot or a glimpse on how the programmers across the US implement this process. They initially communicated through physcial mail, the use of a postal system. However, as the need for feedback became increasingly more pressing, these programmers pivoted and created technologies to communicate. This became the origin point of source code commenting as well the initial concepts to email! 

These programmers knew how important it was to set up this tool well. In the w3.org history, we discover the necessary need to comment properly in source code. The documentation on communicating ideas and concepts became extremely important. To do it improperly, or without care was initially frowned upon. 

However, as time has progressed, rules on documentation has begun to fray at the edges. Anders ABel, writes an article discussing the nature of comment documentation. He discuesses the history of "old legacy code" that creates comment blocks with the revision history of each function as well as old code that has been 'commented' out. In this context, the use of 'commented out' is simply making the original source code inoperable and the new code running in it's place. This is utilized by the same comment command without actually using the tool for its proper purpose. In any case, Abel puts out the opinion that commented out code is a disaster waiting to happen. This is a picture of a tool that was purposed for communication becoming utilized in another way entirely. Ultimately, the use of comment documentation really helps a creator understand the code that they are operating with. It can however become unwieldy, especially when it's not being used properly!
