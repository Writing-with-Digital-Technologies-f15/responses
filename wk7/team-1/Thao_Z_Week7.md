NOTE: My notes are kind of all over the place right now because I'm finding so much information about CSS and I'm still working on narrowing it down. So far, I have three different areas I think I want to focus on, and even these may get cut down some more.

## Outline

### Block 1: Other Style Sheets

There were other style languages at the time other than Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), such as: 
- Pei Wei's language from teh Viola browser,
- Robert Raisch's style sheet, and
- Document Style Semantics and Specification Langauge (DSSSL).

[As I was researching and discovered other style languages, I became curious about these as well and thought it may be good background information leading up to CSS. As of right now, I am considering a short explanation what each style language is, providing an example of each, and maybe discussing how these languages are being used now, if theyâ€™re still being used, or maybe comparing them to CSS.]

### Block 2: Development of CSS

The development of CSS started in 1994, as the web became a platform for electronic publishing in need of a way to style documents. Since 1990, when HTML was first introduced, separating the structure of a document from its layout had always been a goal. CSS took into account the design wishes of the author, reader, and the capabilities of the display devices as well as the browser.

### Block 3: Box Model

The box model defines how a box and its attributes relate to one another. There are four distinct parts to the box model: margin, border, padding, and content area. When you use CSS to define the width and height of your box, you are only defining the content area itself.
