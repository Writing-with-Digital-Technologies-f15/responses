Having never been one for outlines and hearing in class we could use whatever helped us write our paper the most, I plotted out the paper structure by just writing the first rough draft of my paper. That is available here:

http://murtosl.github.io/HistoryOfFlash_4662W/plugin/Plugins.html

There are probably typos and stuff in it, and I know I have layout and navigation issues. If you want deep summaries of what my sections are, you can just read them. I’ve only tested in Chrome if you’re finding something is unusable. 

I have far more subsections that I was planning on before. I have six major sections and several subsections within those subsections, and I'm still playing with what to officially call them. I think the divisions are fairly clear though.

The major sections are:

1) Plug-Ins

Discusses Flash's origin as a plug in, and how Flash's speed and abilities were needed in 1995. It also discusses how Flash became widespread pretty quickly.

2) Design Revolution

Discussed Flash's use in web design and how it made websites more cross-browser compatible. Also touches on Flash letting the web have more of a cinematic, presentational element in order to relate to old media to new media.

3) Usability Focus

Discusses the outcry between designers and usability experts that Flash was caught in the middle of. Also discusses Macromedia's actions to help turn the product around and flip from a display tool to a programming tool, especially in the use of streaming video.

4) A Mobile Future

A collection of quotes directly from users of Flash, as provided by Adobe. They all say that mobile devices will be highly important.

5) The Future That Wasn't

Discusses how although Adobe predicted that the future would go mobile, there was confrontation with Apple and failure to see the big, internet-wide picture.

6) The State of Today

HTML5 is here and widely used, even in the realm of video streaming. Flash is on its way out besides as a desktop animation tool.

7) Coming Full Circle

A concluding page stating that Flash started and is ending as an animation tool, and noting that it was once the most useful because it was a plug-in and is now shunned because it is a plug-in. Flash has stopped being useful for internet development.

-----------------------

This structure is a walk through time on how Flash helped make the web more usable for users at various points in time, and how we got to where we are today. It starts in 1996 and goes fairly chronologically to 2015. A fitting project for the 20th anniversary next year.
