##Summary

I am thinking about using a structure similar to Wikipedia. I like the layout and I find it to be easy to navigate without having to go to other pages for information. Each heading seen below will be its own heading. I may decide to combine some of the headings into others and possibly use it as subheadings instead. 

##GIFs and Facebook: Overview of this site (what are its intentions)

GIFs have become an important part of our culture. It is easy to use, create, and GIFs now accompany dialogue and commentary within social media. Look to social media sites such as Tumblr, which is probably the site to be in terms of GIF usage, and sites such as Buzzfeed, which largely uses GIFs as a way of news reporting. GIFs are changing how we approach communicating within a social media platform. 

Why is it that Facebook, another powerhouse for social networking, has just recently allowed GIFs to be used on its platform? What are the reasons why Facebook did not immediately allow GIFs? What is the reasoning behind these decisions? 

##History: What is GIF?

GIF stands for graphics interchange format and was created in 1987. It is limited to only 256 colors but supports transparency. Some of its features were LZW compression and ability to encode multiple images within a file. Most popularly, GIF is used to create animated graphics.

In 1995, CompuServe and Unisys agreed to license the LZW compression technique, which was patented, that was used to create GIF. The programming community responded negatively to this and boycotted GIF usage. PNG was eventually created as an alternative to GIF. 

##Popularity of GIFs: Why is it so popular? (Cultural value)

GIFs exploded in popularity around the mid-2000s during the popularity of MySpace, which used flashy GIFs. When Tumblr was launched in 2007, GIFs were reinvented again. Tumblr is comprised of GIF-based content, which is circulated and shared by other users. Graig Uhlin describes GIFs as an example of how “digital technologies are increasingly enabling viewers… to play with moving images” (518) and the imagery GIFs capture is intended to “isolate a single meaningful expression” (523). 

##Facebook and GIF: Reluctance

Although GIFs have a huge presence in social media, GIFs weren’t always as put together and slick as they are now. Think back to the early 2000s, where glittery, flashy, and outdated GIFs dominated MySpace. Facebook’s reluctance to use GIFs most likely came from this early experience, which resulted in poor user experience on MySpace. Facebook envisioned itself to be the better alternative to MySpace, meaning better user experience and easy navigation within the site. 

##Facebook and GIF: How is it being implemented?

Facebook has just announced a limited inclusion of GIFs onto its platform. Currently, Facebook is allowing GIFs to be uploaded, although it shows up as a link rather than on the news feed. GIFs are also supported on mobile. As of August, Facebook has allowed some brands, Wendy’s and Kuat, to use GIFs for advertising. 

##Facebook and GIF: Positive or Negative?

Facebook is slowly incorporating GIFs into the user experience. This could provide an interesting and creative way for users of Facebook to post content and in the future, even comment using GIFs.
