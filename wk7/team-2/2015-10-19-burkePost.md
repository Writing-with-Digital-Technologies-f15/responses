## The canvas of my <'canvas'>
I have a picture of my proposed site map to use as a model. From the homepage, I have two major content blocks, an overview of the element and how it relates to video gaming, that each split into more specific sections and group related content together. As you get deeper into the site, the subtopics become more specific. I’ll write more about the content blocks I’m planning here. I will add more details and content to each block as I compose my thoughts and research.
## Overview
The <'canvas'> element creates a rectangle space on a web page for a developer to manipulate JavaScript to draw graphs and animations as well as handle photo compositions and video processing.
## Overview - How does it work / specs
The element itself is easy to form in an HTML document. The only code needed to build a canvas is a call for the element and settings for the width and height. To demonstrate, "<'canvas width="300" height="225"'><'/canvas'>" will build a 300x225 pixel canvas. Once formed, a developer calls the canvas from the Document Object Model (DOM) with code like this: 
/*function draw_b() {
  var b_canvas = document.getElementById("b");
  var b_context = b_canvas.getContext("2d");*/
This code grabs a canvas with an id=b and defines it as a 2D plane. This creates the canvas's drawing context, where the drawing methods and properties used for the canvas itself are defined. Now, JavaScript bits and even CSS properties like fileStyle can manipulate the canvas.
