# What is SPAN?
- General definition: `<SPAN>` is a "generic character-level text container tag"
- Brief overview: uses
- Relationship with `<DIV>`

#How SPAN came to be
[See last week's content on Sittler]
- Benjamin Sittler, `<TEXT>` versus `<C>` versus `<MANY OTHER ELEMENTS>`, concerns about abuse
- Enter `<SPAN>`
- Internationalization (bidi languages, accessibility, other languages + print use)
- Still looking for sources on: specific point of origin for `<SPAN>` name, point at which `<SPAN>` usurped `<C>`

Note: Origin of span: introduced between draft 1 (15 August 1995) and draft 2 (25 September 1995) of the Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup Language.

At this point, I’m a bit stumped on how to find the first mention of `<SPAN>` in the w3 listserv. I’ve been exceedingly unimpressed with the search feature, and, after looking through various iterations of the listserv archives related to internationalization (also styled “i18n” for the eighteen letters between internationalization’s “i” and “n”), I’m pretty discouraged. It looks like, around the time <SPAN> would have been introduced, listservs began separating into different groups, and the archives for www-international@w3.org are lacking in `<SPAN>` development.

I’ll keep looking (and probably follow up with Chris on searching recommendations), because I’d really like to know the specific point of origin for the `<SPAN>` as an element title.
