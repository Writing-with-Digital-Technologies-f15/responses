[Blockquote Content Map](http://i.imgur.com/fEfZm1s.png)

I assumed that a content tree would be something like this, and it's definitely helpful for drafting out content blocks. The actual content blocks are at the second level (A. B. C.) of the diagram. The subtopics to the left of it are the headers, and the subtopics to the right are some key points from the content blocks.

While I do not have all of the content blocks drafted, I can post what I have. Unfortunately these are the more expository elements of the topic and do not have the citations. I hope to add those, as well as the content that discusses the relationship between the old and new technology, as well as the audience's impact on usage, at a later point.

## Blockquote's HTML Specification
### HTML 4
The blockquote element was introduced in the HTML 4.01 specification by the World Wide Web Consortium in December 1999. Under its description according to W3’s recommendation, blockquote is one of the elements that deals with the structure of text and classified as a block-level element that would be permitted within the body element. According to the recommendation, the blockquote and the q element share a similar function, but are differentiate by the amount of the text they are meant to indicate; long and short quotations respectively. In plain HTML, the usage of the blockquote element in rendered text would be indicated by the start of a new line and the indentation of the text. The reason for why this element was specified is unknown, but it seems to take after the writing practice of block quotations in print, where a long quotation in the document would be signified and separated from the rest of the text through the entire block being indented in.
### HTML 5
When HTML 5 was created, the blockquote element was included for legacy purposes. However, according to mailing lists from when HTML 5 was still in development in 2012, there was a discussion on setting up the specification for proper usage of blockquote with conformity, such as proper citation. This was met with some difficulties for actually making it more proper as a writing tool. It is noted in the mailing list that it would be “annoying” as some put it, to make the specification closer in line to how traditional manuals of style dictate block quotations, notably the Chicago Manual of Style. There also was a lack of deeper examination into the use cases of blockquote beyond the inconsistencies in citing the quotations within the element and the acknowledgement of real-life cases for blockquote (noted as different from use cases). In the end, they decide that the original markup should remain intact, as CSS can handle the presentation of it. However, they do add onto its definition from the HTML 4 specification, including that text within the blockwuote element should be an outside-sourced quotation with a source for where the quoted text is taken from.

## Relevant Elements in Printed Text
### Block Quotation
Block quotations would appear to be what the markup of blockquote is based on. The usage of block quotations is intended for quoting from an outside source, where the quoted text is usually more than one hundred words or takes up at least four lines of indented text. The purpose of the block quotation is to present a longer quote and significant evidence. Thus, when in a document, they would have rhetorical value for the reader through ethos or logos. Due to how a block quotation can be abused in writing to fill up space in the writer’s stead, there are many guidelines to how it should be properly used in a document. With that in mind, it seemed that the blockquote was meant more to represent a block quote in visual presentation rather than the actual mechanics and guidelines to it. Due to their unwieldiness in text, especially in professional and academic papers, block quotation in such have become less common in them. This may be due to scholar and critics believing that they are excessive compared to shorter quotations and would detract from the writer’s own writing and contributions.
### Pull Quote
Pull quotes are a type of visual or design element also found in print, but mainly in journalism and magazines. They create a focal point for the reader by pulling from its own source text a quote, an excerpt, or a key phrase and using that as a graphical element placed on the page, emphasizing it through changes in design and typography from the regular text. Their purpose is for adding point of interest or visual design to a document, but they also have been found to have a strong rhetorical impact on the audience. In some cases, they can also shape the reader’s perception on the document through availability heuristics that reader use subconsciously to absorb information. Like block quotations they are a page element that contributes the rhetorical impact of a page. While there is no HTML tag for pull quotes specifically, writers and designers do continue the practice of using pull quotes on the web. There, the role of pull quotes is looser compared to how it’s used in print, partly due to the more visually-oriented nature of web design.

## &lt;blockquote&gt;'s Usage on the Web
### Semantically Correct and Incorrect Usage
Currently on the web, blockquote has been used in ways outside of both specifications by W3C and WHATWG. Obviously, it can still be used as it was intended, which would include a proper citation like the HTML5 specification recommends. However, in the realm of web writing, that is a very niche purpose for a surprisingly versatile element, as people with some knowledge of how to use HTML and CSS have found. One mundane usage of the blockquote element is to function as indentation for text. This is a completely incorrect way to use blockquote that defies the recommendations, but due to how it does indent the text naturally, it has been used for that purpose as a typing shortcut when there is limited knowledge on text structure in HTML. Another usage of the blockquote tag is creating pull quotes. This practice is common on web articles for news sites and commercial sites that use pull quotes as testimonials. Because they are quotations from within the text instead of an outside source and would not have the attribution without being redundant, using the blockquote element for pull quote is also incorrect usage according to its definition as a semantic element.
