## Content Tree
The first level in my tree will be a timeline. Links within the timeline will take users to the conent outlined below.
### Rationale for this tree
I believe this tree will give the most logical presentation of the information. 
I know I need to add content to the sections, but this draft will help me know where it needs to go.
### Presentaitons before PowerPoint
I need to add content here regarding overhead projectors and slide carousels.
### The Need for PowerPoint
Before PowerPoint and personal computers, presenters used overhead projectors or slide carousels for giving presentations. Producing a slide was a tedious process that involved many people. It required giving a sketch to a secretary, the secretary typed it, photocopied it, and gave it to the presenters for modifications, corrections, and comments.  This continued until the presenters were satisfied or until they actually had to give the presentation. A quote from Robert Gaskins illustrates the desire for a system for making overheads:
“This system was so cumbersome to use that it almost amounted to an unplanned laboratory experiment in how painful you could make a presentation system and still have the lab animals clamor to use it.”
### The Concept of PowerPoint
Gaskins and his team designed PowerPoint to fulfill this desire. It also gave the presenter the option to make notes and handouts. Gaskins learned in a worldwide tour that the style of presentations was universal, and he counted the slides with a particular design. This information formed the templates that are available in PowerPoint.
### The Evolution of PowerPoint Capabilities
The first version of PowerPoint was for the Macintosh. It took full advantage of all that the computer and its accessories offered. The computer monitor was black and white and laser printers could only print in black and white. 
The second version of PowerPoint offered color because monitors were now capable of it. This gave presenters the option to make color 35mm slides.
The third version of PowerPoint was capable of video content.
### Using HTML for Slides
There are simple and complex frameworks for creating slides using HTML. One simple one: (add link). More complex ones are created by Reveal.js and Impress.js. Impress.js is particularly interesting – the slides seem to be scattered on one large canvas and using the arrow keys allows navigation between the slides. 
OpenOffice.org (now LibreOffice) is an open source PowerPoint alternative. It’s not really a web-based application, but I’m including it in the HTML section because the file format is OpenDocument and OpenDocument is XML based. One of its advantages is that it is a full-featured office suite that is free to download. 
Google Slides is a web application. It has much of the basic functionality of PowerPoint and offers the advantages that a web application has: it can be accessed anywhere with a web connection and it allows easy collaboration.
