##Center
Center is an alignment tool used in CSS. Its primary function is to bring text to the center of a line on a page, and this can be done with the text-align property in CSS for text groupings like p or h1. Images and blocks can also be centered in CSS by setting the margin-right and margin-left properties to “auto.” (http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html) Center is generally viewed as a stylistic tool for altering the look of content rather than as a building block of the content. It has a complex history that has led to its use in CSS. 
I will include some examples here of what centered text looks like and what the coding looks like. 

##Exigency 
In the early days of HTML, its use was primarily placing content on a page. The focus was not on the style or visual qualities of the content (http://jnocook.net/html/nhtml.htm). But before long designers started thinking more about these visuals. Before the advent of style sheets, HTML was a good channel for changing the look of the content through coded elements. Some questions surrounding the birth of “Center”: How can we move text and other objects around on a page to create a balanced, appealing layout and to create a hierarchy for readers to know which text is most important to focus on? How can we set apart text or an object on a page? One answer: by adjusting alignment and utilizing centering. 

##Origins 

###Netscape
Center was originally conceived in “NHTML” or Netscape-HTML. Netscape Communications Corp. was a browser company that developed their own code—some of which was similar enough to HTML to function as HTML “extensions” in the Netscape browser, Navigator. Center was a familiar concept from printed text and allowed users to highlight content by changing its alignment. HTML 3.0 was working on a “P align=center” tag, but Netscape’s version simplified this idea down to just “Center.” The alignment extensions and other visual elements from Netscape, like Center, eventually caught on enough that they were adopted by the W3C following an agreement by the large browser companies to standardize HTML.

###HTML 3.2
Released in 1997, this collaborative version of HTML used Center as an element enclosed by brackets that could be inserted into a portion of text to change the alignment. [I believe this also worked for images, etc but I will need to look into that more.] In order to center a larger segment of a webpage, designers could also use the DIV element with the attribute Align and a value of Center. Example: DIV align=center. This allowed a lot of freedom with how and where designers could center text or other objects, but it could clutter up an HTML file with stylistic code.

###CSS
Finally, as stylistic HTML elements gave way to style sheets and CSS was developed and released, Center was deprecated from HTML 4.0 and added to CSS, where it serves as an attribute for text-align. This allows stylistic and visual decisions for a page, in this case regarding alignment for text, to all be located in one style sheet rather than scattered throughout the HTML of a document. However, certain tasks such as centering an object vertically are complicated to execute in CSS because of the rules that hold CSS in place.

##Contentions 
Should stylistic elements like Center be part of HTML? Do they simplify the designer’s job or complicate it with disorganized elements that must be randomly placed throughout an HTML document?  (http://jnocook.net/html/nhtml.htm, http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1994q4/0358.html) 
This leads into a discussion of why style sheets may or may not be more beneficial for this task. 
Is Center used too often? When should it be used, and by whom? (http://digitalrelativity.com/text-alignment-rules/) 

##Print Media
I still have to do some more research on this topic, but I think that print media ties in well with contemporary writing projects. Now that Center is comfortably established in CSS, writers can focus on how it should be used. Printed books and documents tend to use it mainly for headings, titles, dedications, quotes, or other objects that are meant to stand out or look apart. But even things that use Center acceptably, like poetry, may be better off when using left-align. Center can draw unnecessary attention to text due to flaws like uneven beginnings of lines. Center for large blocks of text may appear childish rather than professional. Are there ways to fix these problems, or should use of Center be limited and restricted to only certain places (like headings)?  Does Center create balance or chaos? Certainly good designers can use Center in an effective way. I think most attractive websites are based on a carefully-selected combination of alignments and layout styles.

##Rationales 
I organized my tree in the way that I feel would make the most sense to a reader unfamiliar with the Center element and its history. I begin with a definition and description so that they would have a good idea of what the element itself is and does. I then have a chronological description of how it ended up becoming a part of CSS as opposed to HTML. Finally, I talk about the arguments surrounding its origins and use, and the way it us used in print media. These come later because then a reader will have knowledge of the history that will help them understand the arguments and why Center went in the directions that it did. I might move the print media section farther up to be near the initial definition and description, since readers are more likely to be familiar with centered text in books and other print documents. What would you guys suggest? Another question is, do we have to have a section for contentions or can we place it in with the history summaries? If so, I might prefer to do that so it is all chronological.
