##Chapter summaries
###Chapter 5 Short Descriptions
From Chapter 5, readers learn about short descriptions. It briefly describes how the descriptions are used and goes on to discuss how to write, and not write, short descriptions. General guidelines for writing short descriptions are:

1)	State the purpose of the topic.

2)	Include a short description in every topic.

3)	Use complete, grammatical sentences.

4)	Don’t introduce specific types of information such as lists, figures, or tables.

5)	Keep the descriptions short.

6)	Don’t make the descriptions self-referential. This adds words that don’t contribute anything to the description.

7)	Be sure to add information that is not in the topic title.

8)	Don’t use references in the topic. This encourages users to view other content.

Each type of topic has its own specific guidelines. For task topics:

1)	Focus on the importance and benefits of the task.

2)	Provide an overview of the procedure.

3)	Focus on user goals, not product functions.

4)	Provide brief conceptual information.

5)	Show how tasks fit together.

For concept topics:

1)	Briefly define the object or idea.

2)	Explain why users should understand the concept.

For reference topics:

1)	Define the object or explain what it is for.

2)	Describe the reason to use the object.

The last section of the chapter discusses how the write short descriptions for content that is imported from pre-DITA documentation.

###Chapter 6 DITA Maps
Chapter 6 covers DITA maps. It begins with discussing the relationship between topics in the map. Basically, any topic in the map that is on the same level as another topic is a sibling topic. Nested topics are child topics, and the topic under which these are nested is the parent topic. Next, the chapter discusses information models. These are tools that help writers decide the order and hierarchy of information in the DITA map. One specific tool it mentions is the Information Architecture Workbench which is an open-source modeling tool. (I love open-source software!)
If the modeling suggests a book-like pdf is the best way to organize the information, there is a special type of ditamap called a bookmap. It allows classifying the information in elements reminiscent of a book, such as a chapter or an appendix. This is best for information that will only be presented in book form, however.  Regular DITA maps are more useful if the information will be output in HTML or another other form. 
The last part of the chapter describe how to suppress different parts of the ditamap in particular types of output and the reasons for wanting to do so. It briefly covers the importance of short descriptions (covered in greater detail in Chapter 5) and adding linking tables to the ditamap (covered in greater detail in Chapter 7).

###Chapter 7 Linking
The first section of chapter 7 describes the default linking in a DITA map. This is the parent, child, and sibling relationship discussed in chapter 6. In the “Collection Type” section, the chapter indicates that a collection type can be applied to any parent topic that has children. If there are no nested topics, the setting a collection type won’t have any effect. There are four types of collection type: sequence, choice, unordered, and family. The sequence type applies to topics that must be viewed in a particular order. It will include a link to the parent topic, the previous sibling, and the next sibling. The choice type applies to topics that represent choices in a list. There are no links between children. The unordered type is like the choice type in its linking behavior. In the family type, a child can link to the parent and any of its siblings. The last section describes how to set the collection types in relationship tables.

###My thoughts and questions:
Before reading chapter 5, I didn’t appreciate the importance of short descriptions in search engine results. I like how this chapter gives incorrect and correct examples. 
The discussion of information organization in chapter 6 suggests that there can be multiple concept and reference topics per DITA map. How is it possible to indicate which tasks they support? Can there be sub-reference and sub-concept topics? Or just sub-tasks? This chapter also discusses submaps. Why use these instead of just multiple ditamaps? What does the parent ditamap look like? 
Chapter 7 left me with several questions. The first part of the chapter mentions breadcrumbs. I really like breadcrumbs as a navigation tool. How are they included in a DITA map? In the sequence collection type, if there is not previous topic in a sequence, is that link just not shown? I’m also wondering about what is the advantage of the choice type over the unordered type.

##Task analysis
The goal for my user will be to make a presentation that engages and impresses the audience. 
The tasks the user needs to accomplish include:

1)	Identifying the audience and defining the audience’s characteristics, attention span, and reason for attending.

2)	Gathering the information to present.

3)	Organizing and ordering the information.

4)	Downloading the HTML presentation framework.

5)	Learning how to use the framework.

The mental and physical steps will include thinking about the purpose of the presentation and potentially standing in front of the audience.
The time and conditions of the task could be any time of day. The user may have a different type of electronic media depending on location – could be inside, outside, at home or on a plane.
Anyone who wants to give a presentation would perform the task – a university professor, a student, a member of a club.
Potential distractions include kids, pets, spouse, students, electronics that don’t work, the room not having the necessary equipment, or forgetting the computer.
The user needs to know where to obtain the framework, how to organize a presentation, the information to present, and the information the audience needs or wants.
I don’t currently know the sequence of tasks because I don’t yet know how to build a presentation using a framework.
The expected result is an impressive presentation.
