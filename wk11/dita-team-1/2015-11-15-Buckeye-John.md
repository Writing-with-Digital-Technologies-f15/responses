##Short Descriptions
There were definitely some good reasons this one element was made into its own chapter in the “Best Practices” book.  It seemed that it was almost a hybrid element, being itself almost a type of content (something one would read inside a given DITA file), but on the other hand very much like a heading (giving information one needs to know about the file before they get too far).  And on top of all that, it’s one which is which could definitely be used in any of the three basic types of DITA (content-based) files we’ve learned about so far.  In each one of them, consequently, the “shortdesc” would work slightly differently, even though it generally serves the same purpose.  The chapter provided do’s and don’t’s for the writing style of the element and times that it would be seen by users.
I liked seeing all the possible ways to use the element incorrectly, ways I hopefully could have avoided on my own (such as self-referencing), but which were very easy to understand their happening.  What was really good to know about the shortdesc was that if the topic is something which can be seen in a different format, such as on a homepage or a table of contents, before it is navigated to, the full form of the element appears (sometimes underneath, sometimes in a bubble when hovered over).  This is definitely key information for the content of the element.  Of course you wouldn’t want it to reference a list you couldn’t see, or a step which may not always appear proximal if the product takes a different form.  Finally, learning about what can be done with the ‘abstract’ element was very helpful, in that it might often be confused with ‘shortdesc’.
##DITA Maps
This element is one we have used already, even without completely understanding it.  The DITA maps chapter tells us what this type of file does in DITA, and how it might look if it is being viewed, for example in the Eclipse application.  How you use the file is important to the overall structure of your project.  We are warned that we must always plot out the structure of our topics before we start creating DITA maps.  It is also a good idea to designate the person in charge of any or all of the maps themselves.  This makes workflow easier, because individual writers won’t step on each others’ toes when working on one part of the project or other, and will be more attuned to which files or topics are theirs.  Yes then, many times it is necessary to create multiple DITA maps for a project, as long as the structure of the project still makes sense.
It was good to know, not even just in writing with DITA, but in all types of tech that we’ve used this semester, that when mapping out our projects, we should be careful to not go more than six levels deep in our work.  It was probably something that Duckett warned us about, too, in the “Structuring” section of the HTML & CSS book, but always good to hear again.  And I don’t know if I am going to need it any time soon, but I liked hearing that there is a “book map” file type, for what you simply want to have the DITA information structured in a PDF form.  What I was really curious about were, In what kinds of situations would I want to make an attribute of a ‘topicref’ be ‘toc= no’?  Not wanting something on the table of contents sounds like a situation which I’m a long ways away from encountering.
##Links
These sections were about various links, which from what I can tell, we will possibly be using soon, if have not already used.  The first one was hierarchical links.  These are a type which we may not have used, but are pretty straightforward, given that they are well-related to the structure of many HTML documents.  If you nest the topics, one inside the other, you are able to see the Parent topic linked inside the child topic, but are able to change how that link looks.
The other type of link is one which we have worked with in the past.  It’s a collection link, and it is often used in DITA maps.  There are apparently a lot of different types of them, though.  When you give a link a collection attribute, that indicates how they will link to each other, if at all.  The familial one, for example, links to the parent, and then each child as part of an unordered list, and then each sibling as a “related link”.
What is starting to be great about DITA is how well it relates to HTML and how having learned that makes this all that much easier.  DITA almost seems like super-HTML in how it takes some of the same elements and makes them interact in more organized ways.  They are both languages which indicate how to describe the output of a document, but what’s great about DITA is how ingeniously formulated it is for organizing topics.  What I can only hope is that I can know at any one time what the best way for me to organize a specific topic is.
##Task Analysis
###What is the Student’s Goal?
The business goal of this task is to use font in a way that makes your site visually interesting.
###What Tasks Does the User need to perform to Accomplish the Goal?
Have the content and main elements mapped out in an HTML file.
Begin a CSS file which the HTML file can pull rules from.
Set up the rules for your fonts based on which type of texts exist in the HTML file.
Gain an understanding of which size, color, and weight schemes are visually pleasing.
Decide on the particular scheme you might use.
View the finished product and make any adjustments based on the final output.
###What are the mental and physical steps required for each task?
Mental
Considering which fonts would look good at which elements of the site.
Deciding if they are each going to be sized on their own, or if it is going to be put in a relative size scheme.
Physical
Typing the scheme into the CSS file.
Connecting the CSS file to the HTML file.
###Who Performs the Task?
Front-end web designers will generally be the ones performing this task, as they have the most control over the design output, or at least the design goals of the site.
###When and Under What Conditions is The Task Performed?
This task will be performed under the conditions of an average office at which they may be subject to the approval of a supervisor, or your and their mutual approval, or simply your approval.
###What are the potential distractions to accomplishing this goal?
There are a lot of fonts which fall into a category for each use for which they might be needed, and you need to think about the font, the size, the case, and classification of the text.  At a certain point, find one which falls into the generic family you are looking for.
###What does the User Need To Know About the Task?
The user needs to know in which combinations fonts look good together, either between the header and the content, the header and the subheader, or any of those and “special case” font within the content, such as a quote or a definition.
###What is the Sequence of Tasks?
Have the content and main elements mapped out in an HTML file.
Begin a CSS file which the HTML file can pull rules from.
Gain an understanding of which size, color, and weight schemes are visually pleasing.
Decide on the particular scheme you might use.
Set up the rules for your fonts based on which type of texts exist in the HTML file.
View the finished product and make any adjustments based on the final output.
###What is the expected result?
A visually pleasing site, which allows for a variety of fonts, and an interesting and logical flow.
