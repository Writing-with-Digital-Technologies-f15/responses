#Short Descriptions 
*Chapter 5, DITA Best Practices*

Chapter 5 explains the short description element in DITA. The ‘<shortdescription>‘ element not only acts as the first paragraph for a topic, but the text may appear in links and even searches engine results. The chapter lays out guidelines to writing a good short description. 

The guidelines include:
- Briefly state the purpose of the topic
- Include a short description in every topic
- Use complete, grammatical sentences
- Keep short descriptions short
- Avoid short descriptions that are self-referential
- Don’t simply repeat the topic title
- Don’t use cross-references 

Short descriptions have additional guidelines to follow for task, reference, and concept topics. The end of the chapter discusses the ‘<abstract>’ element. This element is used when the short description is unsuitable for preview text. It can also be used to introduce a topic and include things like lists that are not allowed in the short description element. 

#DITA Maps and Navigation
*Chapter 6, DITA Best Practices*

Chapter 6 focuses on DITA maps and navigation. DITA maps are an information path for users to follow and are used to:
- Include topics in an information set
- Define information architecture
- Create relationships between topics
There is a section on information organization, which describes using the ‘<topicref> ‘ element to define parent/child topic relationships. These topics can include concept, task, and reference topics. 

Information modeling helps determine where topics go, what topics are linked, and what linking relationship the topics need. There are many benefits to information modeling such as organizing large groups of topics into information sets, review the organization of topics in a DITA map, planning documentation projects, and visualizing the user experience. 

Bookmaps are a special type of DITA map that lets you create PDF output in book-style format such as chapters, front matter, and back matter. Bookmarks are specifically designed for book-like information.

Generally, DITA maps only have one main user goal. Submaps allow DITA maps to contain other DITA maps. Some of the uses of submaps are: 
- Organizing content by chapters
- Managing large information sets
- Reuse sets of topics
- Support peer writers working on the same information set
- Segregate frequently updated content so that it can be more easily updated 

DITA maps also allow you to reference non-DITA content, include relationship tables to define linking for topics, overriding topic titles and short descriptions, and suppressing different content. 

#Linking 
*Chapter 7, DITA Best Practices*

Chapter 7 describes linking in DITA. There are four types of linking features: hierarchical links, inline links, related links, and collection-type links. Hierarchical links are links formed from the parent, child, and sibling topic hierarchy. Inline links are cross-references that are inserted in the topic. They can be used to direct users to prerequisite and postrequisite information. Other uses are creating links for repeated steps and high-level tasks. Collection types define relationships among nested topics.

The different collection types are:
- Sequence: used to create a numbered sequence of child topics
- Choice: used to create supertask that presents subtask topics as choices
- Unordered: used if procedures in child topics can be completed in any order
- Family: includes related links to sibling topics 

#Thoughts/Questions
I realized that writing a short description is a lot harder than it sounds like. After seeing all the guidelines in the chapter, I see how important it is to have a good short description. I noticed that relationship tables were mentioned in all of the tables, but I am unsure of what they are exactly. 

#Task Analysis

**What is the user’s goal?**

To create a responsive layout of specific elements using flexbox

**What does the user need to know about the task?**

Duration: Anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours. 
Complexity: Easy for advanced users or users familiar with flexbox, difficult for users with no flexbox knowledge.

**What task does the user need to perform to accomplish the goal?**

- Decide what type of layout to create (grid, navigation bar, table, complete page layout).
- Decide what elements to include in layout.
- Define each element as a flex item.
- Set elements in a flex container.

**What are the mental and physical steps involved?**

Mental: determining what elements to include and what type of layout to create (grid, entire webpage, navigation bar).
Physical: typing on a keyboard, typing in code for flexbox in text editor.

**Who performs the task?**

Audience: users looking to create a responsive layout of either an entire webpage or specific elements. 
Experience: Advanced; a user who has experience with HTML and CSS and knowledge of flexbox.

**When and under what conditions is the task performed?**

Requirements: working computer, text editor program.
Limitations: user must have knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Environment: users working in a professional environment.

**What are potential distractions to accomplishing the goal?**

Troubleshooting: the users may not be able to use flexbox for the entire layout.
Alternative path: use grid or other layout module on top of flexbox.
Exception path: the user does not have elements to arrange.

**What is the sequence of steps?**

1. Decide what elements to arrange in layout
3. Define desired elements in HTML
4. Define a container for elements
4. Decide how to arrange elements
6. Customize layout in CSS to fit desired arrangement 

**What is the expected result?**

A responsive layout
