## DITA Ch 5

This chapter introduces the use of the <shortdesc> element. A short description, especially inside DITA, introduces numerous things about the article. These elements are often used to summarize the main topic and give clarity as an opening paragraph.

The chapter itself describes how to use these short description and the forms that they are often found. One way that short descriptions often appear in is through hover text, or when a cursor 'hovers' over a URL link. 

As a whole, these short descriptions are used especially for clear and concise information. It provides key terms and effective descriptions for users to decide to visit a website. They improve the retreviability of information as well as providing easy documentation for users to find. 

These short descriptions should be included in every topic. They should also be compromised of well put together sentences and textual messages. There's a huge variety on how these short descriptions are used, whether as a reference description, concept or overview, but they are still essential to the website. 

The chapter concludes by talking about how these descriptions can be used and should be used. It goes over the contesxt that these descriptions are found as well as the ways that they are written. Most importantly, it teaches the reader how to write effective descriptions that clarify, not obfuscate.

## DITA Ch 6


"No, your tasks don't strut down the fashion runway."

This chapter discusses how DITA roadmaps are most effectively used. DITA roadmaps are the framework that an author uses to create a website or a series of documentation.

Documentation is organized in numerous ways. One way that this chapter goes over is the use of nested articles. By using nested articles on a DITA roadmap, a website or a PDF creator is easily able to create different documents. 

This chapter also discusses how Information should be modeled. A program called the Information Architecture Workbench is the most commonly used application for formating a DITA Map. Generally this enables content to be broken up in ways that are easily categorized. 

This really displays how important DITA is when a user is trying to reuse a set of topics. It enables the writers to organize and resuse topics. In detail, the chapter covers over how navigation topics in DITA function as well as customization for short descriptions in various formats and contexts.

As a whole, this chapter is very much focused on how DITA roadmaps are formed and how they are implemented. There are certain design elements behind the creation of DITA products that are necessary to think about. This chapter discusses the various things that are important about it. 

###Chapter 7

This chapter discusses links.  Links, especially in DITA are used to navigate throughout the document. There are four types of links that are commonly used in DITA. These links consist of Hierarchal links, Inline Links, Related Links and Collection-Type Links. 

Hierarchal links are used to nest the topics in an 'family'. As such, it creates parent topics, child topics and sibling topics. These links are used to direct the user to various topics in a cascading manner. The example used in the chapter is the installing of an espresso machine. The instructions follow, set up the hardware, connect hte espresso machine and install the softare, all under the parent topic, "Install, configure and make beverages". 

Inline links are cross-reference links through the <xref> element that reference to the location of a specific. This can become confusing if used needlessly, but it helps because it can cut down on extra content. It can be used to avoid writing down repeated steps as well as link to prerequsite and postrequisite information. 

Related Links are links that are useful to creating topics that are 'related' to each other. While they are not necessarily in the same family, the creation of a 'relationship table' can give centralized managment for a subset of topics. There are many ways to create relationship tables such as one-way relationship tables as well as two-way relationship tables. Ultimately, these tables scan help a lot because they create a seperate information set that can be processed quickly.

The last type of link discussed is the Collection type. Specifcally, it's the way link appear between parent, child and sibling topics in output. These are simply sequence, Chocie, Unordered or Family outputs. It's how the topics appear in the DITA file when it's finally organized into a website or a PDF. The specifications for these outputs are implemented through names. For example, by sleecting unordered as a collection type in output, the program will output a collection of links onto the screen without creating a prority or a family hierarchy according to the links. 

As a whole, this chapter discusses how important it is to use links effectively. DITA enables links to be used in a multitude of ways and content should be developed around the ways that DITA enables the information to be organized. Proper linking helps both advanced and novice users. It's the conduit of information that most people are comfortable with. 

###Thoughts. 

As a whole, I enjoyed reading about this new method of organizing information. I think i'm finally coming to realize just how useful DITA can be, especially in a place that has a lot of documentation. While i'm a terrible programmer and a failure at all things mathematical, I can at least grasp how nested topics work. I remember from a programming class that I took, (and did quite poorly on), the use of nested for loops. 

This really does bring to mind how iterative computer programming is. However, seeing it applied to the act of writing really makes me appreciative of the power that it has. The mere fact that a DITA script can be compiled into a website and a PDF at the same time makes my jaw drop. 

I do think that some of the topics discussed in the book are a little pedantic. While links themselves are important, the nomenclature and classifciation surrounding it seemed a little bit... too much. Links are useful because they point a reader to something relevant. That's why wikipedia is such a hallmark of our generation. At my work, we use links in a whole manner of ways, but there's never really been a push to classify how we use links. The more important tool is using a short description to tag how the search engine works. If we are quickly able to find a specific, (not relevant) topic through search, I think it might help more than relevant links interspersed htorughout the website.
