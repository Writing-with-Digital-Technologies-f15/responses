##Chapter 5: Short Descriptions

Short descriptions are located between the title and body tags. It provides information that describes the main point or purpose of a topic. A properly written short description will make it easier for the user to determine if a certain topic has the information they are looking for. When a search engine is conducted, the short description shows up as the summary content in the results listed or as link previews.

An effective short description will state the main point of the topic, be included in every topic, use proper grammar, avoid using figures, be short, and avoid referring to itself. 

A short description will change depending on whether it is for a task, concept, or reference topic. For a task topic, the short description will focus on the user goals. In the concept topic, it should focus on the object, concept, or idea. And lastly, in the reference topic, the short description will have factual information such as how an object functions and how/why it is useful. 

##Chapter 6: DITA Maps and Navigation

DITA maps structures your content so users can easily navigate through and find information. DITA maps can be used to include topics to show up in the output, used to determine how topics will be organized, for usability (how easy is it for users to use it), and to formulate relationships between the topics. 

The chapter then goes over different functions that can be used within DITA map, such as referencing non-DITA information, including relationship tables, and controlling  avigation/access to information. 

##Chapter 7: Linking (p. 109-11 & 123-133)

DITA maps use different links so users can navigate from one topic to the nect. It uses hierarchal, inline, related, and collection type links. Hierarchial links are links between parent, child, and sibling topics. 

The second section discusses collection type links, which can be used within any levels in DITA map as long as a parent and child topic exists. It also describes how to use collection types by using the following values: sequence, choice, unordered, and family.

Sequence creates numbered list links of the child topic and the child topic will have links to the parent and predecessing sibling topics. Choice creates a supertask that has links to subtasks. Unordered is used when no specific order is necessary in the child topics. Lastly, fmaily collection-types contains links between child to parent topics, parent to child topics, and all sibling links.

##Thoughts

While reading the short descriptions, I realized that it really is difficult to write an effective short description. There are a lot of requirements a short description needs to fulfill. I realized that I had been writing bad short descriptions for my task, concept, and reference topics. I used may of the methods that the book discouraged from using like using self-referential language. I also didn't tailor the short descriptions to its intended topic. 

As for the DITA map and navigation, I'm assuming that information modeling and bookmap are softwares that help with creating a DITA map (as in it helps make the process easier). 

Collection type links provide a easy way of linking the topics together, depending on what the topics are about or how its organized.
