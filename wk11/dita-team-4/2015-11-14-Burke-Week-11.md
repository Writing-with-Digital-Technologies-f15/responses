## Summaries and Thoughts
### Ch. 5: Short Descriptions
DITA uses almost 400 unique elements, but the short description element, <'shortdesc'>, is particularly special because of how many ways it can be used. While it may just seem to be the element that provides the first paragraph of a topic, the depth of its versatility can make it somewhat difficult to write for. In addition to their expected use at the first paragraph, short descriptions also work as link previews for related topics and as abstracts that search engines return as results. These multiple uses create some complications in <'shortdesc'>’s use. For instance, if a writer’s topic mainly consists of a list or table, they might want to use a <'shortdesc'> as a first paragraph to introduce that data. However, when viewed as a link preview, that <'shortdesc'> ends up introducing a data set that doesn’t appear on the screen. Much like DITA itself, the <'shortdesc'> element works in multiple contexts, and it is good practice for writers to write the element to be informative, concise and able to function well in these multiple contexts.

### Ch. 6: DITA Maps / Navigation
DITA maps really tie a group of topics together. A DITA map provides a hierarchy for the group of topics it’s built to organize, allowing the writer and later the reader to see how a given topic relates to the other topics and the overall structure of the content. Usually, these maps represent one main user goal, and the map’s writer has the option to create submaps to manage the more in-depth content if they’re writing for a particularly large task. DITA maps control what content is seen and how it is seen. They can override the titles and short descriptions of topics, and can suppress certain aspects of the output.

### Ch. 7: Linking
Links are what helps the DITA reader navigate from one topic to the next, and DITA offers 4 linking features: hierarchical, inline, related and collection-type. The use of the first three styles is somewhat self-explanatory: hierarchicals reveal how the topics are laid out, inlines exist in the main text to refer the reader to relevant material, and relateds do this same function but in relationship tables. Of the four types, the most complex feature is collection-type linking, itself having 4 styles: sequence, choice, unordered and family. Most of these actually create unordered, or not numbered, child topics of the topic the link originates from.

### Thoughts
Having done some work in this class with DITA maps before, I feel like I understand how to write one pretty well. I was surprised to see how many uses the short description has, and how that somewhat interferes with writing it effectively. Of these three chapters, I feel the least confident in my understanding of using the linking features. Many of the collection-type link styles seem very similar in function.


## Task Analysis
### What is the user’s goal?
To create a space on a webpage for a video game to display using the <'canvas'> element.

### What tasks does the user need to perform and accomplish the goal?
•	Create the canvas.

•	Call the canvas from the Document Object Model.

•	Write JavaScript to create something for the canvas to display.

### What are the mental and physical steps required for each task?
Mental

•	User must understand basic HTML / JavaScript writing syntax.

•	User must know what they want to appear on the page.

Physical

•	User must write the HTML / JavaScript code

### Who performs the task?
Audience

•	People interested in building a video game with the <canvas> element

Experience

•	Novice – advanced experience working with computers

### When and under what conditions is the task performed?

Requirements

•	User has determined what kind of game they will make

•	User has an HTML page to work on

Limitations

•	User cannot complete the goal properly without knowing what kind of game they want

Environment

•	User will likely be working in their living space when developing a game (or at their workplace if appropriate)


### What are potential distractions to accomplishing the goal?

Troubleshooting

•	Canvas created / called incorrectly, issues with computer keyboard prevent typing

Alternative path

•	User decides to build a different game that requires another canvas / different
JavaScript code

Exception path

•	User does not have a computer program that can edit HTML / JavaScript files

### What does the user need to know about the task?
Duration

•	1 minute to just create and call the canvas, 30 minutes to an hour for an advanced user to build a simple game to test the canvas

Complexity

•	Easy for advanced users, medium to high difficulty for users unfamiliar with writing HTML / JavaScript

Frequency

•	The canvas and game code only needs to be written once, may need to be updated with varying frequency

### What is the sequence of tasks?
Prerequisite: Access a computer with a text editor and create a file called index.html.
1.	Create the canvas.

a.	Write “<'canvas' id=b width=”300” height “225”></'canvas'>” in index.html.

b.	Change the width and height to values appropriate for your game.

2.	Use JavaScript to call the canvas from the Document Object Model

a.	Create a JavaScript file with the code:

(var b_canvas = document.getElementById("b");
var b_context = b_canvas.getContext("2d");)

b.	Save this file in the same directory as index.html.

3.	Write JavaScript for a simple version of your game to ensure the canvas is displaying properly.

### What is the expected result?
A space on the webpage that renders a video game.
