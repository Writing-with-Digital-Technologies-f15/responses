## DITA Best Practices Readings
### Chapter 5: Short Descriptions

The short description, or &lt;shortdesc&gt; is an element in DITA with a very important function. Not only does it introduce the topic, but it can also be present outside of the topic itself, including HTML output (such as hover text), and as descriptive text found on search engine results. The chapter provides guidelines (or best practices like the title says) for writing the short description of a DITA topic. These best practice guidelines for general effectiveness include:
- Briefly stating the purpose of the topic
- Using complete sentences with proper grammar
- Keeping short decriptions short
There also things to _avoid_ doing when writing short descriptions, such as:'
- introducing lists, figures, or tble
- using self-referential phrases
- inserting cross-references 

Since there are three different types of DITA topics that short description can cover, there are best practices for each type of DITA Topic.

**Task Topics**
- Focus on the benefits or importance of task
- Provide an overview of the procedure
- Focus on real goals instead of product functions
- Provide brief conceptual info
- Show how tasks are connected

**Concept Topics**
- Briefly define topic or idea
- Explain why users whould understand the topic

**Reference Topics**
- Define the object or explain what it is for
- Describe why you would use the object.

Finally there is a section on writing short descriptions for converted content. As the content was not written initially with DITA in mind, using the abstract element may help when using just shortdesc may not be sufficient.

###Chapter 6: DITA Maps
DITA maps are described as what binds topics together, and this chapter starts off by prviding an overview of the DITA map's purpose and introducing new concepts such as information organization, information modelling, and bookmaps. Bellamy also goes over components more tailored to DITA maps, including navigation titles and special short descriptions. These practices are considered overrides of the original writing from the topics. There is also info provided for the suppression of content on DITA maps, which keeps topics from being included in either the pdf or HTML output.

###Chapter 7: Linking (p. 109-111, 123-133)
Good linking strategies within DITA topics can aid users in completing their DITA-based goals. DITA comes with useful linking features for this. Hierarchal Links use the "topicref" element, which can create a topic hierarchy of nested topics. This provides helpful navigation for readers when rendered as table of contents in the output. Thext type of linking feature is collection types. They define the relationship between topics and determine how the relations between topics can appear in the output. There different kinds of collection types based on the relationship the writer wants to present as the output for the user. These kinds include sequence, choice, unordered, and family collection types.

###Commentary
I'm really thankful for how helpful the chapter on short descriptions is and how simply it's written. It's surprisingly a hard part of DITA to write for, when there are so many things it could cover with only a few words. I guess that difficulty is why there is a chapter in the book dedicated to it. I also like how there are example of incorrect short descriptions with corrected versions that kind of comparison makes the explanations easier to follow. The chapter on DITA maps was also useful as well. Since I've been having trouble with writing a DITA map that my Command Prompt will actually turn into output without a fight. Something from the chapter that stood out to me are the figures of DITA map structures. I had some trouble understanding the "reusable" aspect of DITA prior to this, but it make more sense now. As for the segments on linking, I was surprised that there different ways of doing it with DITA's features. When you read more about DITA in this book, the parts of it are all very cohesive, which help me read through this more as a manual for DITA writing than a textbook I have to read.

## Task Analysis
What is the goal?
What task does the user need to perform to accomplish the goal?
What are mental and physical steps involved?
Who performs the task
When and under what conditions is the task performed
What are potential distractions
Wht does the user need to know about the task?
What is the sequence of steps
What is the expected result?
