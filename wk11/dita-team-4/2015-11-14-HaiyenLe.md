## DITA Best Practices Readings
### Chapter 5: Short Descriptions

The short description, or &lt;shortdesc&gt; is an element in DITA with a very important function. Not only does it introduce the topic, but it can also be present outside of the topic itself, including HTML output (such as hover text), and as descriptive text found on search engine results. The chapter provides guidelines (or best practices like the title says) for writing the short description of a DITA topic. These best practice guidelines for general effectiveness include:
- Briefly stating the purpose of the topic
- Using complete sentences with proper grammar
- Keeping short decriptions short
There also things to _avoid_ doing when writing short descriptions, such as:'
- introducing lists, figures, or tble
- using self-referential phrases
- inserting cross-references 

Since there are three different types of DITA topics that short description can cover, there are best practices for each type of DITA Topic.

**Task Topics**
- Focus on the benefits or importance of task
- Provide an overview of the procedure
- Focus on real goals instead of product functions
- Provide brief conceptual info
- Show how tasks are connected

**Concept Topics**
- Briefly define topic or idea
- Explain why users whould understand the topic

**Reference Topics**
- Define the object or explain what it is for
- Describe why you would use the object.

Finally there is a section on writing short descriptions for converted content. As the content was not written initially with DITA in mind, using the &lt;abstract&gt; element may help when using just &lt;shortdesc&gt; my not be sufficient.

###Chapter 6 DITA Maps
DITA maps are described as what binds topics together, and this chapter starts off by prviding an overview of the DITA map's purpose and introducing new concepts such as information organization, information modelling, and bookmaps. Bellamy also goes over components more tailored to DITA maps, including navigation titles and special short descriptions. These practices are considered overrides of the original writing from the topics. There is also info provided for the suppression of content on DITA maps, which keeps topics from being included in either the pdf or HTML output.
