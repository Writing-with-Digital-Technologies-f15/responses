#Summaries

##Chapter 5

This chapter covers the "short description" in DITA. Short descriptions introduce the topic that is being covered and provide clues for search engines when looking for the content. According to the book, short descriptions are supposed to be grammatically correct and concise (hence the name "short") while also stating the purpose of the topic and using self referential phrases / cross-references. 

For task topics, the short decription should tell the importance of the task and an overview. It should also supply the reader with goals and an explation on how everything is connected.

For references topics, the short description should explain why/ how an artifact would be used.

For concept topics, the short description should explan the topic and its importance.

##Chapter 6

Chapter 6 explains DITA maps. DITA maps are what lays out all of the content together and within context of each other. The chapter covers navigation and the organization of information as well as the ability to hide different information from different output formats (ie--have something show in a pdf, but not in an html file).


##Chapter 7

Chapter 7 covers linking and the different types of linking. It discusses how hierarchical links can be used with nested topics to provide more structure and organiation for readers. The chapter also discusses collection links which allow the writer to construct relationships between information so taht the reader can clearly recognize these connections.

##Thoughts

I really liked the part that had incorrect and corrected versions of short descriptions--it's nice to see examples of both what is right and what is wrong. I find it cool that you can have certain content only viewable in certain output formats (chapter 6). I'm not sure how well I can distinguish between the different types of links at this point, but I suspect that will change over time.

#Task Analysis

##What is the user's goal?

To compress a file (such as a gif/ tif).

##What tasks does the user need to perform and accomplish the goal?

+"save as" after creating a tif/ gif
+file type (tif/ gif)
+file option (LZW)

NOTE: this is assuming that someone has already constructed the LZW compression algorithm

##What are the mental and physical steps required for each task?

Mental
+user must understand how to operate a computer 

Physical
+use must be capable of clicking a mouse

##Who performs the task?

users interested in compresisng a file in a loss-less manner with limited experience doing so

##When and under what conditions is the task performed?
user has created a file that is compatible with LZW
user wishes to save that file in a lossless compression format

Environment:
office, living space--anywhere with access to a computer

Limitations:
user does not have access to a computer (unlikely, if they've already created a computer file and are looking to save it)


##What are potential distractions to accomplishing the goal?

user does not have access to a computer

user does not know that they can choose different file formats



##What does the user need to know about the task?

Duration

• very small amount of time to save the file. less than one minute.

Complexity

• Easy for any user.

Frequency

• Must be repeated with each save (although may be automatically built in on the operating system)

##What is the sequence of tasks?

Prerequisite: Access a computer with the option to select save properties when saving a created image.

a. file "save as"
b. select save properties 
c. select lzw


##What is the expected result?

a file that has been saved with LZW compression that will make the file easily transportable via email or USB and will not lose the quality of the file (loss less)
