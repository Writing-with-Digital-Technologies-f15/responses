##Summaries

###Chapter 5: Short Descriptions
The short description is used to describe the main purpose of the topic. It can appear in the first paragraph of a topic, link previews, or abstracts for search engine results. Users should be able to quickly determine whether they’ve found the correct information or not through short descriptions. Short descriptions of topics should be concise and accurate.

Chapter 5 also included some guidelines to follow to write effective short descriptions. First of all, for consistency, every topic should have short description with complete, grammatical sentences. A brief statement of purpose should be included, typically answering questions of what the topic is about and why users need the information: but it shouldn’t lead up to a point. Short descriptions should not introduce lists, figures, or tables. It should also avoid self-referential statements and cross references. 

To write effective short descriptions for task topics, think about the benefits or importance of the task. Including an overview of the procedure (such as where and when to do the task) can help users understand what the task will help them accomplish. Rather than product functions, the focus should be on real goals: “The goal is never simply to use some… product” (pg. 77). When writing short descriptions for concept topics, consider the following questions: what is the object/idea, and why should users care about it? And finally, short descriptions for reference topics should explain what the object is for and why it is useful.

###Chapter 6: DITA Maps and Navigation

A DITA map binds topics together and is an information path for users to follow. Well-structured DITA maps should help users quickly find the information they need. It should be used to include topics in an information set, define the information architecture, and create relationships between topics. 

Chapter 6 also explains short descriptions regarding external links to a non-DITA target. The description should let users know whether they will find the information they need or not at the link, and where in the target page they can find it if the link is pages long with information. Short descriptions should be under 35 words when possible and use consistent phrasing.

###Chapter 7: Linking

Chapter 7 discusses four different types of links to connect topics: hierarchical links, inline links, related links, and collection-type links.
Hierarchical links reveal the navigation of information through nested topics, whereas inline links are cross references that are inserted in the topic rather than creating a link using DITA. However, inline links should be limited because they can be disruptive and complicate navigation. There are four attributes that allow more control of linking between topics: targetonly, none, normal, and sourceonly. There are three different 

Related links can be organized in a relationship table that defines the “relationships between topics in different cells in the same row” (pg. 118). It is used to centralize link management, reduce the maintenance of links, and improve their reusability. A topic-type link table structures related links according to task, concept, and reference topics. A one-way link table creates links from one topic to another, but doesn’t work the other way around: a two-way link table works in both directions. A custom link table can also be used.

There are four different types of collection-type links: sequence, choice, unordered, and family. When determine which one to use, consider the following questions:
- Do the task topics need to be done in a particular order?
- Do the topics represent choices?
- Are the topics closely related with one another?

##Thoughts on Readings

Of the three chapters, I think chapter 5 will be the most useful for me. There were a lot of things I think I would have done that the reading advised against doing when writing short descriptions. The text really stressed the importance of keeping short descriptions concise and accurate, and I think it was mentioned in each chapter assigned this week that short descriptions should be kept under 35 words. Another thing I also noted was that short descriptions should focus on explaining what the idea is and why it is important. I would have focused on what the idea was and its functions only. Chapter 6 and 7 focused mostly on linking. For my historicizing project, I want to try out the relationship table and see if it will help me develop more organization and a better structure. I think what I will struggle the most with is remembering the functions of all the attributes we’ve learned and knowing when to use them.
