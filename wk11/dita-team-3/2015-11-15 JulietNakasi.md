## Short Description

Chapter 5 explains the short description in the DITA code, and explains the importance of it on a web page. It is usually the first paragraph in a topic, search engine results, et.c. Therefore, it is very important to know how to write a good short description and how to use it in the DITA setup. The chapter outlines guidlines that should be followed when writing the short description, and there are also examples that show correct and incorrect ways of using the different guidlines that apply to it. The chapter also explains how to apply short descriptions to tasks, concepts, and reference topics. The chapter explains why there would be a need for a short description in all three writing environments, and how to use it in each one for them. 

## DITA Maps

Chapter 6 talks about how DITA maps and navigation work in detail. The chapter explains the DITA maps structure, the relationship between maps and topics, how to oragnize the information, how to model information, et.c. The chapter talks about the "Bookmaps", which is a "special type of DITA map." Bookmap is basically creating a PDF in book format. There is an explanation of why the bookmap is important, and example of how a document would look if a Bookmap was used. The chapter also shows the use of submaps. There is also mention of the short description element in the chapter. Short descriptions can also be applied to maps. The chapter talks about how and where to use the short descriptions in the dita maps.

## Linking

Hierarchial links show nested topics in the information. In other words, there is a main topic, and sub topics that come under the main topic. "The topics in this hierarchy are automatically linked to each other..." In other words once a main topic is used with other other subtopics, they will be automatically be linked to each other. In the reading we get a clear picture of how the these types of links work through different examples.
Collection types are important for linking. They "define a relationship among nested topics, they also specify the way the links between parent, child, and sibling topics can appear in the output." In order to be able to have good out put when links are applied it is important to understand how to apply the different collection types. In the chapter different collection types are illustrated. The different types include; sequence collection type, choice collection type, unordered collection type, and family collection type. There is also explanation on how to determinewhich type to use, and how the types apply to tables

## Thoughts

I know for chapter 7 the focus was on the hierarchial links and collection types, but I read the whole chapter. After reading all of it, I understand why the focus was just on those two areas. Understanding how to implemenet collection types in the hierarchial links was very confusing. I kept reading the collection types over and over again to understand how they work. I am sure they will make more sense when we atually use them. At the end of chapter 6, the author says maps are "fun and easy". After reading the chapter aboout the maps, I see how fun they will be when used, however I think they are going to be a little bit challenging for me. For the short description, reading it helped answer most of the questions I had about the short descritption. Before reading that particular chapter, I had questions like "why are short descritptions important, and is it really neccessary to have a short description in each topic?" All these questions were answered in detail. One thing I noted while reading the short descritption chapter was, if we hadn't read this particular chapter, my short decription would have done all the incorrect things that were mentioned! Therefore, out of all the chapters/sections the short deescription was the most important/useful to me this week (after all it is the first paragraph people see. It is important to have a good first impression!).

### What does the User Need To Know About the Task?

The user needs to know how to implement the figure and figure caption elements

How the figure element is different from the image element

When to use the figure caption after the figure element is used

How the figure element affects the page layout

### What Tasks Does the User need to perform to Accomplish the Goal?

Write code using HTML5

Have a figure that will be added to the code

Decide where the figure will go in the code

### What is the Sequence of Tasks?

4) Decide where the figure should appear in the code

5) Add the figure to the code

6) Write a short caption about the figure

7) Finsih out the code

8) Open the code in a web browser to see how the image looks like


### What are the mental and physical steps required for each task?

Mental:

The user must know how to use figure and figure caption in HTML5

The user must have a little knowledge about HTML5 in general

Physical:
