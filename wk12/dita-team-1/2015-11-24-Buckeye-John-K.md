## Write-It-Out Workshop Prompts

1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? (cf. Sarah's linking of Flash to broader issues of proprietary tech to solve open Web issues; Matt's linking of CSS media queries to broader contentions of “designer control”).
	My project aims to understand how we got to the most common ways to use interesting fonts, and how do they align with what might be the best ways to do so.

2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?
	
- 2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213).
	The role of semiotic power and micropolitical power in the advance of technology (p.224) both have their role to play, in that they each shape how the technology is supposed to be used and then how it is actually used, respectively.
- 2b. Define it within the scope of your own project?
The role of semiotic power is somewhat present in the language of CSS and those who use it, but it appears properties such as @font-face are enabling a variety of new micropolitical practices.  They influence many people to search for the format(s) they are most eager to use, as well as force decisions b/w it and other methods of inserting creative fonts.
- 2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable. NOTE: This may only happen after conducting more analysis of your sources:  
The most significant difference between the two, is that Haas seems to define these semiotic power sources as singular, but I have allowed for them to stem from many sources.  As such, micropolitical power practices may not necessarily oppose the intent of the semiotic sources, but work in unity with them.  This was not an inherent contradiction of the original model, but possibly a kind of outlier in how it tends to play out.

3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?
	I am going to see how all methods of pulling fonts and designing usable fonts are influenced by the semiotic power processes and micropolitical practices.  What ends up being the most widely used particular format or responsiveness-influenced method could be that which was the most practical all along, or it could have had a different, less-practice-based reason for why it is now the dominant method.
	But the conceptual tools give me a construct through which to view how the development and popularization of each of these methods is brought about.  The more I read about the techniques and best practices, the more I can tell what the basic, lower-level development of this technology is.  But I also like to see what the overall development of how to format fonts was, which may relate back to more semiotic power.

4. Choose between 4a and 4b, (or do both!), but add a note about your decision why.
- 4a. Based on what you wrote in #3, modify the original provided historicizing matrix to suit your analytic method needs. In other words, change the structure, columns, tab names, add rows to it, etc. Sketch it out and then write about your modifications below. NOTE: You may not be ready for this yet! If you are unsure about what new column to add and why, write about why you think this way. And, what steps are needed to get there, e.g., looking back at your data.
- 4b. Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?
	A major detail I am missing from my historicizing project is that of the <font> tag itself.  It is something I never came across at all during the early development of web fonts themselves, and one which would explain a lot about how we got to where we are.  I would have to assume, though I will need a certain amount of research to back this part of it up, that there got to be too much to do to fonts for an HTML-style attribute string to be very efficacious.  This, in fact, might relate back to a lot of the reasons behind CSS in general.	
	More importantly, though, it is an example of the semiotic power asserting itself through the ways that font would thereafter need to be coded.  And it seems to have held up pretty smoothly in micropolitical practice, as well.  The main advances after this one stem from a need to access a wider range of fonts, how those fonts might be imbedded more effectively, and what might make them even more responsive to our present zeitgeist.
	Another area I could probably address in more detail is the way that fonts were first rendered on computer screens themselves.  This is definitely a connecting link between the hard copy of print and web fonts today, too, and the decisions made with regard to perhaps the fonts on word processors themselves have a great deal to do with at least the most basic default fonts we have even now.  
	I may want to, for example talk more about SVG font delivery methods.  There seems to be an advantage there in how widespread of access there is to different fonts, and the certainty of rendering every glyph, but the module itself recommends that if you want the web page to load fastest, maybe use something else.  Once again, we see a clash of the semiotic (the intellectual property owners) and the micropolitical, in this case, SVG users.
    I chose to do this instead of part A because there were many things which stuck out to me right away which I thought I should address before I go back and try to define them in the terms I discussed earlier.  I do have a pretty good idea of what I might do with the matrix, nonetheless.
