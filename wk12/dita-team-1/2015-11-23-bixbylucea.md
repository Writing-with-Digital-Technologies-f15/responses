##Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? 
My topic is the element/attribute Center, and my goal is to present its history in the context of changing but overlapping methods of design (supporting Haas's rejection of the simple replacement model). Center is part of a set of alignment tags and therefore I want the idea of alignment in general to be a central theme in my project. What is the purpose of alignment? How does one best use centered text vs left or right-aligned text? On a larger scale, this ties into, first, style sheets. There was a lot of contention surrounding the birth of the element Center regarding whether or not these visual design elements belonged in some sort of style sheet rather than in the HTML body. Style sheets are a good way of separating visuals code from content code, but sometimes CSS makes simple design choices--like vertical centering--overly complex. Second, the use of alignment in print and digital media. The way the text is positioned on a page can suggest professionalism, order, and hierarchy. There are many "best practices" related to text alignment that ultimately have an effect on how the text is viewed and interpreted by readers. It is necessary to consider how these best practices intertwine with the HTML/CSS contentions--how do style sheets alter the way we work with visual elements like Center? Is it best for content design to happen within the content, or separate from it? 

##What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?

#Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213).
Haas's simple replacement model--technologies build on and integrate with one another, rather than moving in a blind and steady march forward from one product to a better one. 
    
Haas's old and new technologies--which is the broader context for the simple replacement model. Haas explains that old and new technologies are often viewed too simply, when there are actually complex relationships that cause the develpment of technologies. 
    
Haas's discussion of how technologies don't come about because they are the best, but because of politics and other factors that affect a decision. 
	
#Define it within the scope of your own project?\
Center went through several different versions--NHTML, HTML--before finally settling into CSS. These versions were based on one another. Even though Center is now CSS, in many cases it can still be used in HTML as well. There has not been a "simple replacement." The old and new technologies of HTML and CSS are still working together. Even when Center is only used in CSS, it is still making changes to the HTML content from afar. Finally, many expert coders agreed that Center was better off in CSS, but that seemed to be based on an opinion that visual design elements were a waste of space. Center is now part of CSS, which was likely based heavily on input from these coders who were part of HTML and CSS's origins. There are probably designers who would have felt differently about the subject, but the decision-makers on NHTML, HTML, and CSS were a select group of people with lots of personal goals and opinions. 
    
#Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable. NOTE: This may only happen after conducting more analysis of your sources.
I don't think I have made any changes to the definitions. 
    

##Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?
I think I talked about this a little in the question above, but the simple replacement model helps my aim of showing the complex, overlapping history of Center. Because if this history, Center functions as both an old and new technology that can be used in several ways and the newer technology is built on older ones (not simply replacing the older ones).  My analysis of how Center is used by designers to promote a specific image or message ties in with the simple replacement model because the way Center is viewed and used has had to change as its coding format has changed. Decisions about HTML, CSS, and alignment best practices are based on input and decisions that were influenced by other factors. Style sheets affect the way web pages can be designed; web pages are often based on print media (another merging of old and new technology); and so the contentions surrounding alignment in print media follow Center into digital media as well. 

##Choose between 4a and 4b, (or do both!), but add a note about your decision why.
#Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?
I chose 4b because I think it would be most helpful for my project. 

Definition: I need to add some more description of how Center can be used in CSS...I'm thinking about how this could relate to a task topic, with at least some form of instruction rather than just stating the basics without going into it any more. I also want to include images of centered text and coding. I can even use the text itself to show different alignments in a more clear and intentional way. I know I need to get rid of the purple boxes too. 

Exignency: I have to explain why this section is there and also tie it in with the conceptual tools because Center's origins did have a lot to do with style sheets and those contentions. I ask some questions in the exigency section that I think could be related to the conceptual tools. 

I think the history section is pretty good but I need to integrate it more with the contentions and print media since all those things were going on at the same time. That way, I can draw the conceptual tools into the history and talk about how they related to each step along the way. I think my sections don't connect well currently--there is nothing tying them all together so it doesn't make sense to the reader why they are in the order they are in, or why the sections are even relevant. So I need to build stronger connections and cohesiveness around the themes and aims. 

In the contentions section, I mainly just bring the conceptual tools in at the very end (the last paragraph). I think I need to start with those instead and talk about them in each paragraph, not just at the end. That way it will be easier for the readers to see the themes and how the paragraphs relate. I also think using the conceptual tools more throughout the contentions section and then the print media section will help bring those two sections together a lot. Right now there is not a very strong connections between the two because I approached them as two different topics--the controversies that came up about Center's development in the world of HTML, and the way it is used in print or digital design. But really these things are related, because style sheets have to do with design, and old and new technologies/the simple replacement model can be seen in both cases. I will work hard to draw connections between all of these different ideas.

I also need to figure out how to avoid hotlinking images, and I need to provide some more links for my sources. In general I feel like more images/examples would be helpful too.
