# Historicizing Conceptual Invention Workshop: A Generative Procedure

<small>Disclaimer: This workshop will induce cognitive strain and struggle. (>_<)</small>

## On Analysis and Showing Your Work

In other forms of conceptual and theoretical work, showing your work, or leaving a breadcrumb trail of your interpretive process, is part of the larger end-game (cf. mathematics, science lab work, social science work). The Historicizing project requires a lot of breadcrumb-writing to invent, group, note patterns, and make claims about your mediational means.

In this workshop, you will come away with a deeper sense about how analysis projects of this sort involves writing about and through

	- particular concepts and theories that shape your own work and interpretations;
	- evidence and data;
	- how concepts relate to your comparison and contrasting of evidence and data;
	- what patterns and categories that you see emerging from those other writings;
	- etc. etc.

In short, what you write during your actual analysis processes is not exactly what ends up as carbon-copy content in your final historicizing project. Why? Because that's writing for you to help you understand and make connections and claims. It is not content for your audience. While you will certainly use and reuse and transform bits and pieces of such writing, I want you to understand that really good analysis takes time and writing apart from the concerns what its final form will be.

## Write-It-Out Workshop Prompts

1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? (cf. Sarah's linking of Flash to broader issues of proprietary tech to solve open Web issues; Matt's linking of CSS media queries to broader contentions of “designer control”).

The aim of my project is to illustrate the importance of the maturity of technology to the rate of adopting the technology. They tend to occur in parallel and the development and use of PowerPoint and HTML frameworks will serve as an example.

2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?
The innovation adoption life cycle and the technology maturity S-curve will guide my analysis.

	- 2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213).

	The S-curve defines the stages of a technology’s maturity. These stages are new, improving, mature, and aging. The adoption bell curve depicts groups of people who adopt new technology at different times. These groups are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. The MITRE article discusses not recommending new technologies to laggards. It also discusses characteristics of these groups of people in terms of educational level and risk tolerance. 
	Rajesh Kumar R provides another definition of mature technology that relates the maturity to how transparent it is. By that he means that we use it without thinking about the how and why of its working. One example he uses is that of radio communication. During the 1890’s this was novel and astonishing. Today we use it in cell phones, GPS, remote control (of TV’s and cars), and WiFi. The University’s wireless internet access would not exist without it, yet we don’t often think about the basis for why these work. As the technology becomes even more mature, we don’t even think of it as technology anymore – books and other printed media for example.

	- 2b. Define it within the scope of your own project? 
    
The definition will be the same. PowerPoint is a mature technology as defined by the S-curve, but it is not yet so mature as to be transparent.  While I have not seen it discussed in any of my sources, I think usability is an essential part of the definition of maturity. A technology that is transparent has to be so easy to use that it is not necessary to think about it. This can be seen in the development of PowerPoint. At the time the development started, the graphical user interface of the Macintosh was more mature (more usable) which is the reason for starting with the Macintosh.

	- 2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable. NOTE: This may only happen after conducting more analysis of your sources. 

Instead of relating the graphs to customers, I will be relating it to the development of PowerPoint and its adoption by users. A corollary to not trying to sell new technology to laggards is to only expect laggards to adopt technology when it is mature. 
                                                        
3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim? They aid my analysis by giving me specific definitions by which to measure the maturity of the technologies I’m discussing


4. Choose between 4a and 4b, (or do both!), but add a note about your decision why.
	- 4a. Based on what you wrote in #3, modify the original provided historicizing matrix to suit your analytic method needs. In other words, change the structure, columns, tab names, add rows to it, etc. Sketch it out and then write about your modifications below. NOTE: You may not be ready for this yet! If you are unsure about what new column to add and why, write about why you think this way. And, what steps are needed to get there, e.g., looking back at your data.
	- 4b. Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention? 

I will be responding to 4b because it is more consistent with the way I think. 

Need definition and discussion of mature technology.

Add discussion about making transparencies with laser printers and drawing software. PowerPoint was not essential for making presentations, although it did make it easier. As electronics matured and became more affordable, PowerPoint was not necessary, but it still provides the opportunity to keep all aspects (handouts, notes etc.) of a presentation together. Slides can also be reused in new presentations. 

Stress maturity of Macintosh as reason for developing PowerPoint for this system first.

PowerPoint is now a mature technology. 

HTML is in the improving stage.  Part of the improving stage is settling on a dominant package. Discuss some of the early PowerPoint competitors and more about the current HTML presentation frameworks.

Maybe discuss the reasons for the split between LibreOffice and OpenOffice, although I’m not sure this is consistent with my aim.



User goal for my task analysis:
Use Reveal.js to create a presentation that engages and impresses the audience.
Tasks to accomplish this goal:
1)	Download Reveal.js
2)	Install Reveal.js
3)	Make first Reveal.js slide
4)	Work through reasons the slide doesn’t look like you want it to.
5)	This is where I am at this point.
