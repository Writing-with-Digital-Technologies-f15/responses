The thesis behind my historicizing project is that Flash has been used to fill in gaps for web technology, but fell out of use when web technology evolved to not need a third party application anymore. The social issues revolve around how people were using the technology to meet their needs, and stopped using Flash when it failed to meet their needs.

There are two main tools we talked about in class. Haas has stated that technology is not replaced steadily over time. Flash did not suddenly become shunned technology; it transitioned through several different uses before people moved onto modern technology. I would say my project adds the twist of evolution to the theory, since the project explores how Flash adapted to the changing web technology environment.

The other tool I use is that not everyone finds a technology useful at a single time. This also ties into the evolution of Flash over time. Flash won out against other plug-ins, because the other plug-ins were not meeting the needs of their users by being too complex.  Flash was once useful to make excessively creative web layouts, but others found that this made the web unusable. Flash lost to modern web technologies. I don't think I twist this tool around too much; but it would be interesting to explicitly state that because others do not view a technology as useful, does not mean it's bad. There's a lot of community Flash hate right now, and that shouldn't be. Flash is not inherently bad; Flash just isn't as useful anymore.

My project aims to explain why Flash fell out of use, and how we got here. The project explores how Flash use evolved as web technology and web expectations changed. This clearly related to theories about how technologies are replaced over time, since that's what ended up happening. The usefulness of technology is also clearly related, since Flash evolved to be useful when it could. Keeping this principles in mind lets an analysis of a technical evolution and demise be possible.

I chose 4b, since I consider myself 99.9% done with the project, so it makes more sense to perform a double-checking of my material rather than going back to the drawing board. This is more like a live blogging of the last edits to my paper:

I changed the first sentence in the intro to use the word evolving, since adapting to changes in use is what Flash did.

I already am including a quote in the Plug-in section about why technologies are chosen, which will tie into technological replacement later in the paper.

When discussing the origins of Flash as FutureSplash, the technology changed which device it was expecting to run on and found its use in a niche by being lightweight. This demonstrates the first evolution of Flash, and while I do not call the reader’s attention to this specifically, I feel throwing it in the readers face constantly would get annoying.

The Flash Boom section discusses how Flash became so widespread and ended up as a widely used technology. It describes, explicitly, how Flash met the needs of both producers and consumers. This demonstrates how Flash became the most useful technology at the time.
Skipping the intro covers three important things. It related past technology to new technology (video and face to face presentations). It established the use of Flash to make website intros, which was one of the highly criticized old ways of use. Lastly, it shows that Flash evolved from an animation tool to a development tool.

The wars of incompatibility section describes the next stage in Flash’s usefulness. Now that Flash had the ability to have programmatic functionality, it could be used to make full websites, and solve cross-browser issues. This is another description of not only evolution, but the usefulness of technology.

In order to show the weaknesses of extremely flexible design processes, and to transition to talking about a big debate about the use Flash, the Web as a Canvas section is necessary. I don't think it directly contributes to theories, but is still needed information to get the big picture.

The discussion of 99% Bad provides context for the clash between usability experts and passionate Flash designers. This is then directly related to the usefulness of technology theory in The Great Debate section.

I admit in the Stream of Success section, I discuss Flash winning an Emmy more because it amuses me than contributes to the paper. However, I would also argue that shows how important Flash was to the web and popular culture. That section is the apex of Flash's uphill climb, and the rest of the paper discusses its downfall. I do like the contrast.

I've gotten several critiques about the Mobile Future page. What I'm trying to do is show that people weren't oblivious to the needs of a multi-device web. Failure wasn't a matter of Adobe not looking ahead. It doesn't directly relate to theory, but I feel it's important to establish that just because you can see where a technology should be heading doesn't mean you'll make it there.

A Slight Confrontation establishes another social context war. This specific section describes the feud between Adobe and Apple, while the next section describes why this was an important debate. The Why not use Modern Technologies section directly references theories. It states the main problem with Apple's argument is they tried to make a new technology (HTML5+) used before was a useful technology. Not every website was ready for HTML5, and most browsers weren't even ready at the time.

The State of Today page discussed the transition to HTML5 and where Flash is today. The first section discusses how Flash has not been replaced, and references that technology replacement is not linear. A Return to Animation highlights that Flash's first use is once again becoming its primary use, which is use not only to demonstrate exactly how Flash is being used today, but also leads into the paper's conclusion.

The conclusion points out that Flash has fallen out of use because the internet has lost its needs for plug-ins, and it's pretty hard to recover from that when you're a plug-in. I do not mention the theory of useful technology, but the point is certainly there, as the page asks 'What the internet needs now?' I don't feel it would aid the paper to bring up a theory citation as it would ruin the flow of the conclusion, and has been brought up previously several times.

I have already revised my paper, and feel it is adequate. The notes I took helped double check that, but I think I'm good. My theme seems solid, and explored throughout the different key events in Flash's history.
