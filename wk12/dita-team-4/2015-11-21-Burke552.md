## Write-It-Out Workshop Prompts

### 1.	Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time?

The main point behind my project is to show how new innovations in web technologies can invite new groups of people into the web development scene, using <canvas> and video game developers as an example. More importantly, I want to show how these new groups of people contribute their own ideas and best practices to the discussion, creating a new direction for HTML to develop that’s different from the original intent. Again, I use practices from video game developers on how to make good games before and after <canvas> existed to make web games from as the primary example.

### 2.	What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?

Haas’s extension of Vygotsky’s historical-genetic method onto technology will be important for me here. The original concept argued that in order to understand an artifact, you had to study the context surrounding the artifact and the history that led up to it. Haas builds off of Vygotsky this method and applies it to understanding technology and literacy in the 20th century by arguing that understanding literacy requires understanding the technologies that support it in the past, present and future as well as how its media are similar to and different from the media that came before.

For my project in particular, the assertion in Haas’s Vygotskian approach to studying technology that a technology’s uses are closely tied to the other things we humans do is central. Using <canvas> as an example, a web developer building a site to display some picture will find different uses for <canvas> than a game developer building a video game to be played in a web browser. This is important because, thanks to <canvas>’s video game functionality, the ways a game developer would write and interact with <canvas> are a relevant part of the discussion around the element. New voices joining in the discussion on HTML and web development bring with them new contexts for viewing the functionalities of existing web technologies and new opinions of where the future of web development should go.

### 3.	Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?

My project is about how new developments in web technologies invite new groups of people into HTML and web development, and how the practices those groups carry with them change HTML as a whole. <canvas> and video games together are my primary vehicle for communicating this point. I find this ties strongly into Haas’s and Vygotsky’s theories from earlier about the importance of context in studying a technology. How a group uses <canvas> and how they wish for it to develop in the future are very closely linked to the kinds of activities they engage in when they do HTML work.

I think that choosing to do 4a now would be more helpful for me given where I am in my project, but I should plan to do 4b eventually.

### 4a. Based on what you wrote in 3, modify the original provided historicizing matrix to suit your analytic method needs. In other words, change the structure, columns, tab names, add rows to it, etc. Sketch it out and then write about your modifications below.

I’m still unclear on how we are supposed to use the historicizing matrix to organize our thoughts and methods, so I tried changing some of the tab names of the original matrix to see if that helps improve my understanding of what this is trying to do. (I’d appreciate some feedback on this issue, I feel silly for not saying anything before.) I made them more specific to my topic: functionalities of <canvas> that facilitate gaming, knowledge and skills of game developers before and with <canvas> and differences in the <canvas> element itself from before and after gamers became more involved. I think these changes are good because, for one, they helped me realize that it would be helpful to search for and study the first games made in <canvas>, as well as secondary sources that might discuss how these first games changed the climate of discussion around <canvas> and how they led the way for more gamers to join in.
