##Workshop Prompts

###1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? (cf. Sarah's linking of Flash to broader issues of proprietary tech to solve open Web issues; Matt's linking of CSS media queries to broader contentions of “designer control”).

The aim of my historicizing project is to claim that regardless of semantics put in place, the common usage of the blockquote is largely based off continuing prior practices of old writing technology applied to new technology, as well as the audience's needs and perceptions of the "meaning" of quotations. This does not exclude it from being used in a semantically proper manner, but instead has it adopt certain usages beyond what was predicted.


###2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?


**2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213).**

_Concept of writing practices:_ This is the idea that writing has dynamic and recurrent contexts behind it, rather than just being contextless speech or a generalized technical skill. Writing as a practice also incorporates technologies, parts culturally shared knowledge, and sign systems.

_Myths of technology according to Haas:_ The truth is that technology is neither all-powerful or transparent. Technology on its own cannot determine its fate, nor can its purpose be guaranteed as cohesive and apparent to the user. These myths simplify the development of technology and shelter it from what may be beneficial scrutiny.

**2b. Define it within the scope of your own project?**

There are two prominent writing practices that have impacted the usage of blockquote: the original writing practice it was based off of with academic rules, and the writing practice that has adopted the blockquote for the commercial and journalistic practice of writing. The former provided the framework, while the latter is a newer context that is dynamic and found their own use for the blockquote element.

The history surrounding blockquote is proof that the absolute power and transparency of technology are myths. Namely, the lack of transparency in how to use blockquote, which was evident in the mailing lists and current debate over semantic correctness led to the "incorrect usage" by online journalism as pull quotes.

**2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable.** 

To be determined with further analysis.


###3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?

The link between my project's aims and these conceptual tools is that these conceptual tools provide the context (contextual framework?) for why the varied usage occurred in a more convincing manner than merely chalking it up to just convenience and human ingenuity. In a sense, the aims of my project shows the tools at work in a rile life. As for how they aid my analysis aside from what is already stated, it helps with understanding how influential perceived exigences can be in shaping the changing "standards" for usage.


###4b. Based on what you wrote in Q3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?

**Reasoning for choosing this question:** I'm aware that the writing and my project right now is lacking in a strong aims for my topic and needs more involvement of the material we discussed in class, as well as stronger understanding of the relationship between old and new technology.

For one, I want to include a section on writing practices and the myths of technology according to Haas. This way, I can address my section on the causes of the varied and cause usage more thoroughly and in parts to not overwhelm with content. With a more concrete thesis, I can also use it to examine and expand on the various sections of my project altogether, this time with a focus based on my aims/thesis rather than being more generally informative. I think the implications of the audience's cultural knowledge and the symbolism of quotes warrant some attention, because they led up to and encouraged the "pull quote" usage of blockquote.
