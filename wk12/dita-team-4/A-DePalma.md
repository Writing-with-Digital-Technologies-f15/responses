##1.	Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? (cf. Sarah's linking of Flash to broader issues of proprietary tech to solve open Web issues; Matt's linking of CSS media queries to broader contentions of “designer control”).

The aim of my historicizing project is to show what happens to images before they are even uploaded through explaining the impact a mathematical algorithm has had on the internet via gifs and debates over the uses of gifs. The broader social dynamics linked to this largely involve patent disputes. Personally, I find this particular patent dispute to be fairly stupid on the part of the developers who just charged ahead with using patented tech. Patents exist and expire for a reason—no one would feel inclined to innovate if they couldn’t profit off of their innovations and if the patent didn’t expire that individual would never innovate again.  

##2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?

###2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213).

Haas’s theories on technology’s evolution: Haas believes that technology is not self-deterministic and does not have a predestined/ guaranteed purpose. Haas believes that the idea that technology develops independently of social interactions and dynamics creates confusion in understanding technology. 

###2b. Define it within the scope of your own project?

LZW Compression contributed to the social calamity that impeded the development of GIF, spurred on the development of PNG, and upon its patent expiration, inspire the resurgence of GIF. This is demonstrative of  the comples social dynamics that contribute to technologies non-linear, determinist development. This, like countless other technologies, shows the rather obvious argument that technology is not self determining. 

###2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable.

I don’t note any changes or adaptations. I think that, if anything, this conceptual tool is almost unnecessary to be stated explicitly as it is inherently implied in the history of LZW as it relates to GIF and PNG files. 

##3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?

These conceptual tools provide a framework through which to view the development of the technology as it relates to different image files throughout it’s approximate thirty years of existence. It relates to the project aims because it shows how certain technologies developed as a result of patent disputes and licensing fees associated with LZW Compression and how the popularity of GIF’s usage retreated and then resurged along with the patent. These tools aid my analysis because they offer a structured angle through which to view it (however implicit this angle may seem).

##4b. Based on what you wrote in Q3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?

I need to address the relationships between GIF, PNG, and LZW in greater detail. I am struggling with doing this because it seems like a cut and dry story that really doesn’t need to be speculated on, but I understand that I need to view it through the theoretical framework mentioned above. I follow up my page with a section that discusses how everything connects to Haas’s theoretical framework, but I could work that into the analysis itself, to make facilitate the reader’s ability to draw connections more easily.
