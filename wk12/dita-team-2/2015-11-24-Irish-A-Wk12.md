# Historicizing Conceptual Invention Workshop: A Generative Procedure

## Write-It-Out Workshop Prompts

1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time?

My historicizing project's current aim is to show why there was a need to create Flexbox, a responsive grid layout module, and to show why Flexbox has not completely replaced other methods of creating grids. I am tracing this back to the international style and the creation of grid layouts, referencing Dilger and his article on table. My project begins where Dilger's article left off: with the need for a more responsive layout. Broader/political issues Flexbox can be related to are the support for a less strict application of the international style and solving the problem of the Holy Grail Layout. 

2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?

	- 2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213).

	Haas' simple replacement model- assumes that old and new technologies are clearly differentiated from one another, both theoretically and in practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete technolgies.

	Vygotskian view of technology- their history-of-use is complex and overlapping and that technology's uses are tied intrinsically to other human activities. 

	- 2b. Define it within the scope of your own project?

	Flexbox has worked its way up to becoming a W3C candidate recommendation. It has existed and does exist within the realm of other types of grid systems. Flexbox has not replaced Grid; they are both supported and have similar uses and also different uses. A "simple replacement" of technologies does not exist. Flexbox solves problems other Grids cannot like a correct Holy Grail Layout in CSS. Vygotsky's view of technology in my project relates to how grid layouts were based off of human activities of reading print items such as articles and newspapers. 

	- 2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable. NOTE: This may only happen after conducting more analysis of your sources. 

	The simple replacement model, as defined in my project, is different from how Haas describes it. In my project, Flexbox does not replace other grids, even though it is a new technology that can do things other grid technologies cannot. Grids original structure was based off of newspapers and brochures. Though the idea still remains, the improvement of grid technology extends that adaptation to look like almost any type of print source. 

3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?

	Looking at Haas' simple replacement model shows the overlapping technologies of grids and supports my project's aim at Flexbox has not completley replaced other grid technologies. As I mentioned, Flexbox and Grid are both still used. The conceptual tools help my show my project's adaptation on them. I want to show why flexbox was created. Vygotsky talks about technology's history-of-use and connection technology to human activites. Flexbox was created based off of other grids and grids were created based off of print media. My project's aim ties in well with Vygotsky's views. 


4. Choose between 4a and 4b, (or do both!), but add a note about your decision why.
	- 4b. Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?

	My current project is missing details of Haas and Vygotsky. As I was doing this assignment I looked more into them and how I can incorporate their ideas into my project. I need to look further into the development of Flexbox from technology in the past. Although not currently on my site, I am working on my theoretical framework in relation to where Dilger left off. I've worked on why the international style warranted the need for a more flexible grid layout technology, but I need to develop more on why Flexbox was created. So far, I've found it can solve the problem of the Holy Grail Layout, which apparently was almost impossible to do with CSS. I want to look at more connections between Flexbox and the problems it can solve that other grid technologies cannot. 

	I chose to do 4b because I still have a lot I want to add to my project and research. My original version did not have the theoretical and conceptual framework I needed. I am finally finding a better aim for my project by looking at these things.
