# Historicizing Conceptual Invention Workshop

## Write-It-Out Workshop Responses

1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? (cf. Sarah's linking of Flash to broader issues of proprietary tech to solve open Web issues; Matt's linking of CSS media queries to broader contentions of “designer control”).

	My historicizing project focuses on the development of span, specifically in relation to the W3C listserv discussions regarding flexibility versus "correct" use and the separation between semantics and presentation.

2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?

	- 2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213). 
    
    Haas:
    
    _simple replacement model:_ An oversimplified view of technology where new technologies and old technologies are clearly distinct, and old technology is simply replaced by new technologies.
    
    _straightforward progress model:_ An oversimplified view of technology where new technologies serve us better than old technologies, as new technologies are always steps forward in quality, efficiency, and power.
    
    _mediational means:_ Technology acts as a connection between individuals and cultural/historical context. Because technology is closely related to culture and society, the simple replacement of old technologies by new technologies is unlikely. Societal and individual cultural norms and values do not change as soon as a new technology is released, so why would old, familiar, entrenched technology be immediately discarded?
	- 2b. Define it within the scope of your own project?_ 
    
    _simple replacement model & straightforward progress model:_ While new inline elements replaced some functions of SPAN in later iterations of HTML, these new elements did not and will not completely replace SPAN, which still has appropriate uses and may be the best element of choice in some situations. These new inline elements were often created as a response to repeated uses of SPAN in a particular way. It is highly unlikely that every use of SPAN will be given its own sematically meaningful element, partially because this would involve the creation of dozens of new elements (which goes against the listerv cultural value of simplicity) and partially because SPAN's existence encourages flexibility in HTML writing (another value/positively regarded trait).
    
    _mediational means:_ SPAN developed as it did because of the cultural, social, and historical environment involved in proposing, debating, and applying new HTML elements. The coexistence of SPAN and new, more precise semantic inline elements is due to both SPAN's continuing appropriate usefulness and its connection to sociocultural structures as well as individuals' use practices.
    
	- 2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable. NOTE: This may only happen after conducting more analysis of your sources.
    
    My definitions (particularly of simple replacement/straightforward progress models) focus more on the application of these ideas throughout SPAN's history, instead of just comparing the first and most recent versions of a technology. 

3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?

	Mediational means gives me a vocabulary to use when describing how the culture of HTML development (particularly developer participation in listservs) influenced particular pieces of SPAN. Listservs are a combination of a participatory community (with common beliefs, values, best practices) and individual stake. By taking part in the trouble-shooting/problem-solving/improvement-minded process, listserv members had the opportunity to make their mark on what was once a crazy-new technology, and what became a crazy-huge (read: worldwide and large) technology.
    
    As discussed above, SPAN's status belies the models of simple replacement and straightforward progress. SPAN can be used as an example of a technology where the division between "old" and "new" is blurred, and where the concept of simple replacement is unlikely and unideal.

4. Choose between 4a and 4b, (or do both!), but add a note about your decision why.
	- 4b. Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention? 
    Note: I chose 4b because, while I did find the functionality/tools, knowledge/skills, and social dynamics/values columns useful, the diachronic/synchronic division was less useful to me last time we used the matrix. I also think I could easily apply my observations of weaknesses in creating the final project draft.

Weaknesses:
- As Chris said in his review, the introduction lacks purpose. Need to add language that connects SPAN to theoretical framework, specifically SPAN as a subversion of the simple replacement/straightforward progress models and SPAN as a mediational means shaped by the context of its development. Add to 2nd paragraph. Better call out what this context is? Delve into what the cultural values of W3C listservs are? (Concern: how best to support this? Maybe my assumptions have too much cross-over with Web 2.0 culture.)
- Define historicizing? Or better title. I think my initial concern with writing this content was how much/best to mesh "writing for people who may not know what HTML is" with "include theoretical framework." The draft as it stands is pretty novice-friendly reading, but it avoids explicitly acknowledging the theoretical framework in an effort to increase readability. Aka, not the assignment. Suggestions welcome on making this an approachable academic document!
- Blah. By the time "SPAN what?" hits the top of the page, my eyes are tired of gray and white. Gotta find a better way to indicate blockquotes and list the example. Codeblock for the example? Blue background or text for the quote? 
- Add W3C logo + link? For interest
- "especially print technologies" is out of nowhere with no further explanation. Easy place to attach historical-genetic method, which I left out of the definition section above because it seemed so duh
- "The unique social and political flavor..." as-is seems pretty unsupported and out in left field. Attach examples or further explanation or discard.
- Explain the change between CAPS TAGS and lower caps tags or just standardize writing to stay on topic
- Define listserv? Necessary in this day/age?
- Should probably mention CSS in the Hopmann C tag paragraph, otherwise styling is just ???
- Mention that the suggestion to replace C with SPAN completely ignores the prior conversation on usability/reader-friendliness, potentially because it was proposed by someone whose primary focus was the www-style listserv, not html-wg (investigate)
- Social & political culture — could use additional content, alluded to earlier in the page
- Define living standard, potentially attach as transition between values —> use
- host images internally
- Add to use examples, including a "non-standard" + intentional use of SPAN used where another element would do: use this to talk about (the aging web and?) Haas and mediational means/cultural values affecting use 
- Summarize theoretical connections at end of SPAN today
