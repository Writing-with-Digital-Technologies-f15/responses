# Historicizing Conceptual Invention Workshop

## Write-It-Out Workshop Responses

1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? (cf. Sarah's linking of Flash to broader issues of proprietary tech to solve open Web issues; Matt's linking of CSS media queries to broader contentions of “designer control”).

	My historicizing project focuses on the development of span, specifically in relation to the W3C listserv discussions regarding flexibility versus "correct" use and the separation between semantics and presentation.

2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?

	- 2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213). 
    
    Haas:
    
    _simple replacement model:_ An oversimplified view of technology where new technologies and old technologies are clearly distinct, and old technology is simply replaced by new technologies.
    
    _straightforward progress model:_ An oversimplified view of technology where new technologies serve us better than old technologies, as new technologies are always steps forward in quality, efficiency, and power.
    
    _mediational means:_ Technology acts as a connection between individuals and cultural/historical context. Because technology is closely related to culture and society, the simple replacement of old technologies by new technologies is unlikely. Societal and individual cultural norms and values do not change as soon as a new technology is released, so why would old, familiar, entrenched technology be immediately discarded?
	- 2b. Define it within the scope of your own project?_ 
    
    _simple replacement model & straightforward progress model:_ While new inline elements replaced some functions of SPAN in later iterations of HTML, these new elements did not and will not completely replace SPAN, which still has appropriate uses and may be the best element of choice in some situations. These new inline elements were often created as a response to repeated uses of SPAN in a particular way. It is highly unlikely that every use of SPAN will be given its own sematically meaningful element, partially because this would involve the creation of dozens of new elements (which goes against the listerv cultural value of simplicity) and partially because SPAN's existence encourages flexibility in HTML writing (another value/positively regarded trait).
    
    _mediational means:_ SPAN developed as it did because of the cultural, social, and historical environment involved in proposing, debating, and applying new HTML elements. The coexistence of SPAN and new, more precise semantic inline elements is due to both SPAN's continuing appropriate usefulness and its connection to sociocultural structures as well as individuals' use practices.
    
	- 2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable. NOTE: This may only happen after conducting more analysis of your sources.
    
    My definitions (particularly of simple replacement/straightforward progress models) focus more on the application of these ideas throughout SPAN's history, instead of just comparing the first and most recent versions of a technology. 

3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?

4. Choose between 4a and 4b, (or do both!), but add a note about your decision why.
	- 4a. Based on what you wrote in #3, modify the original provided historicizing matrix to suit your analytic method needs. In other words, change the structure, columns, tab names, add rows to it, etc. Sketch it out and then write about your modifications below. NOTE: You may not be ready for this yet! If you are unsure about what new column to add and why, write about why you think this way. And, what steps are needed to get there, e.g., looking back at your data.
	- 4b. Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?
