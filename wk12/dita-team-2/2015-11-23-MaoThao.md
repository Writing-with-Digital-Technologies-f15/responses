##Writing Prompt

__Aim of project and mediational means__

*__1.__* The aim of the project is to argue that the old and new methods of using GIF has evolved and actually made the user experience much better. It has also given users of it the ability to be more creative with what they choose to create. They are not just limited to creating flashy, static graphics. Instead, users are able to create looping animation, which is used in conjunction with content in social media to express thoughts and ideas. 

The issue with using GIFs would be how it is used, especially its popularity in social media. GIFs may be disliked for its bad user experience because it results in too much movement on a webpage. Although most users of social media probably do not experience issue with the user experience based on GIFs overall popularity on sites such as Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook’s recent inclusion of GIF. Add to that the inclusion of GIFs in online news sites such as Buzzfeed. 

Another main issue would be GIF specification is outdated. During the 1990s, GIFs were revolutionary because it allowed developers and users to compress format easily. It also allowed them to introduce flashing graphics into wed designing. However, over time, GIF can be seen as an old technology that needs to be replaced with new technology, such as PNG. 

__Conceptual tools__

*__2a).__* The historical-genetic method is looking at the origins of a technology to understand, recognize, and track the similarities between technologies. 

Haas’ argument about the relationship between old and new technologies, using the historical-genetic method, in which neither completely replaces the other. Rather, based on its social and cultural histories, technology has just evolved over time while still maintaining core similarities. 

*__2b__* Within my own project, GIF has not really changed over the course of its development. What has changed is the way users are using GIF to create animated graphics. The historical-genetic method would look at the similarities in why GIFs are still being used now and what makes it popular. 

*__2c__* From what I have written so far, I don’t think there have been any transformations with the definitions. I’m applying the concepts quite close to how Haas has defined it. 

__Link between project aims and conceptual tools__

*__3.__* The aims of my project and the conceptual tools I am using have a strong relationship. Haas argues that old and new technologies are essentially one and the same whereas I look at the old and new ways that GIF is being used. GIF is only one technology but the way that it is being used has changed over time, although the reasonings behind using GIF have not changed. The historical-genetic method helps with my analysis by having me look deeper into the social and cultural reasonings for why GIF was used in the first place. Then having me look at what drives it use presently. From my research, the specifications of GIF are the same reasons why GIF has become so popular. 

__Notes on project__

*__4b.__* I chose to answer this question instead because I don’t think I am at the point in my project to change the historicizing matrix to suit my analysis. Looking at my project, I want to focus more on the old and new uses by including more content and definitely more images. I’ve started on it and have collected images but I haven’t written anything out for it as of yet. I also want to solidify the reasonings for using GIF based on its technical abilities/limitations. I think I have spread this point throughout the project but I may have to go over it again to make sure that it isn’t too scattered throughout the project. I would also like to look more at the social and cultural aspects of it because it correlates with the usage and GIF’s abilities/limitations. Again, I think I have hinted at this throughout my project but I may have to make sure that I am not scattering the idea throughout. I think trying to keep it contained within one or two sections would be better in order to make a more solid argument.
