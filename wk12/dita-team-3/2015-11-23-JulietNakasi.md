## 1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time? (cf. Sarah's linking of Flash to broader issues of proprietary tech to solve open Web issues; Matt's linking of CSS media queries to broader contentions of “designer control”).

The aim of my historicizing project is to show how figure and figure caption have changed the way people include images in their HTML pages. The introduction of the figure caption element changed the way people add texts to different images in form of captions. There was no way one could add a caption to an image the way it is done in print media like books, and magazines until figure and figure caption were introduced. The introduction of the figure and figure caption helped bridge the gap of having captions on images, between HTML pages and print media.

## 2. What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?

	### 2a. Define such concept(s) as X person defines it in your own words (cf. Haas' move with historical-genetic method, p. 212-213).
    
    The Haas article emphasizes knowing how something came about, the different factors that have contributed to it, and continue to contribute to it. The piece also emphasizes looking at some similarities and differences between the old version, and new version of the specified technology.
    
    ### 2b. Define it within the scope of your own project?
    
    My project digs into both things that Haas talks about. It is important for me to understand how the way images are included in HTML pages has changed over time. I also need to look at some similarities and differences in how images were used in the past, to how they are included in the current HTML5. It is important for me to understand how images were supported, and how they still are supported in HTML5. 
    
	### 2c. Note any changes, adaptations, transformations, etc. between these definitions, if applicable. NOTE: This may only happen after conducting more analysis of your sources.
    
I don't have many changes, adaptations, transformations to note because I am still conducting analysis of my sources. I hope to get done with the analysis before the end of this week. However, the one adaptation that I will include more of in my project is showing how the images were included in the past to how they are right now. I know my draft didn't emphasize this part enough. After reading the section in the Haas article, I understand how important this part is to the project. Therefore, I will elaborate on that more in my project. 

## 3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?

My project is about how figure and figure caption have changed the way people include images, and captions in HTML pages. The conceptual tool is to show how the way images are include in HTML pages has changed over time. Therefore, my project will show how the the introduction of figure and figure element has changed the way people use images. By showing how figure and figure has changed over time, I will also be able to show how the two elements have bridged the gap between the way print media uses captions and how images wih captions appear on HTML pages. The relationship I see between them is evolution. How things have changed over time. I see this because image was not completely replaced, it was just made better with a better element (caption) that makes it look better on pages. Therefore, my conceptual tool aids my analysis by showing how the different changes came about, the differences, and similarities of how things were done before.

## 4. 4b. Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about how weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?
    
    The main weakness in my project is showing how a specific conceptual tool aids my argument. As I was answering question 3, and after reading through my project again, I think my project lacked the conceptual tool, or I didn't emphasize it enough. Therefore, this is one area I will focus on in my revision. Also, something else that I will address in detail is showing how my project integrates the class readings (most of my feedback asked for this). Therefore, I will address that in great detail when I revise my project. I think in my revision if I emphasize the conceptual tools, and integrate them in my project, it will be great. Well, besides the design itself, and a few other things that were mentioned, i think most of my revision will will focus mainly on improving the content itself.
