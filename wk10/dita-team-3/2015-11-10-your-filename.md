## DITA

The videos and book were very helpful. I still do not understand how most of the tags work yet, but I will be puttig in time all week to make sure I get it. My biggest frustration was finding a good text editor. I ended up using Atom. Atom is pretty easy to use, but I wasted a lot of time trying to find a text editor.

For the DITA itself, writing concept was easy, but reference was (still is) a challenge. I looked up some examples, and looked at the examples from the DITA file for the class. I still have a long way to go with the references. I was able to figure out a few things and posted something for this week's tasks, but I still need to work on it. I am still trying to understand the whole DITA thing. I will eventually get it. I am also still unable create any Pdfs or HTML out puts. I followed the OT commands, but I keep getting errors. This part has been very frustrating to say the least!

## Historicizing Project

After reading through my project and the feedback, I think the biggest thing I need to work on is the content of the project. I got some great ideas and links that I need to look at and get more information to boost my content. I also got some comments about my HTML code and overall design. I think I am going to get a new layout/frame for my project. I have been looking at different frames that could make my project better.

### Timeline for my Project 
11/08 - 11/15 - Coming up with a new frame/layout for my project
11/15 - 11/21 - Re-read the Haas articles, and all other resources I got from my peer review
11/23 - 12/03 - Revise the project (add new content, and clean up code)
12/04 - Submit the project
