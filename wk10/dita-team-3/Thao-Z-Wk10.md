##Dita

Once I got the gist of it, DITA wasn't too difficult to write. I have more trouble of thinking about what to focus on when it comes to concept and reference topics. I would like to spend more time using more elements our DITA text provides. On the other hand, I'm having trouble remembering how to use the command prompt to save output files as PDF versions.

##Revision Schedule

More than a schedule, I have listed the revisions I want to make based on importance.

Connect content with readings, particularly Haas' text on old and  new technology. Potential questions to consider: How has CSS become more effective? How and when was the box model developed? How has it impacted style elements in CSS? What changed?

Revise content and make more concise: determine what can be left alone and what needs to be deleted. Consider whether to keep content on one page, or to separate content into multiple pages.

Incorporate CSS, taking before and after screen shots to include in the final product. Show how the box model affects design.
