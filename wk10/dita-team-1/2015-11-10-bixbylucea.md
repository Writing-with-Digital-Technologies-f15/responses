## Writing-with-Dita Response

I was really scared of Dita because of how complex it looked at first and the command prompt is still a confusing void. But reading through the Best Practices book helped a lot. I also looked at other classmates' examples to see how they were using different elements, especially when Bellamy kind of glossed over things (I still haven't attemped a table because I was unsure of how to code the rows and columns). 
I am having a problem with my concept page. My other pages rendered fine in html5 and pdf, but the concept one is getting an error related to (I assume) the concept id. I am also confused by the ids, because they seem sort of random and I don't think Bellamy talks about them very much at all (unless I missed where she does). So my question about ids are, how do you know what to put between the quotes? I tried several different things and all of them were wrong. 
It was really exciting to finally see the code become a pdf and an html page. Overall I think I learned it's not as complicated as it seems once you figure out the format of everything. Like I had to try a bunch of things in command prompt to get it to spit out the html and pdf, but once I knew how to do that, it was easy to do it a dozen more times. 
I also think it's interesting how the tasks/concepts/references look in a pdf and to think about how that connects with the speaker we went to see. As I read Best Practices it was easy to see how strongly they are integrated with her job--the goal is for things to be very carefully organized and easy for the reader to find and understand. 

##Historicizing Revisions

By 11/10 I will outline a reworking of my content to be more connected by a main idea focused on analysis from the Haas readings. 
By 11/17 I will fix the code errors, change formatting and layout and so on using feedback from my group and from Professor Lindgren as a guide. 
By 11/24-12/1 I will rewrite the content fully to meet the new standards. This means: more content, more connections, better layout and design, more talking about stylesheets vs. html, more on centering as it applies to the web, better navigation and headers.
