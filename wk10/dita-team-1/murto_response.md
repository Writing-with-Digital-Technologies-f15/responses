##DITA

This week, through our exercises, I learned how to structure and compile DITA builds. Writing a reference,
concept and topic helped cement the purpose of each type, and practice the DITA code associated with each type.
I didn’t run into many issues with getting the code to work. Often, I’d forget to change one of the places in the doctype
declaration since there’s so many. I also messed up the structure of a table by accidentally nesting something wrong.
But these issues were easily resolved. 

While I didn’t struggle so much with the coding, I have vague questions on how best to write for DITA. 
For instance, I’m beginning to understand why it’s been said that writing a shortdesc is difficult. I would like more guidance
towards things like that. I did struggle for thinking of a reference topic related to prose.io, because I am seeing reference
topics as for things you may want to quickly look up in a table. Are there other uses for references?

## Schedule

I took everyone's suggestions and notes into considerations and filled out issues for each task I'm going to tackle. I have separated these issues into design issues and content issues. I have more design issues than content issues. https://github.com/murtosl/HistoryOfFlash_4662W/issues

I'm going to be gone for two whole weekends, so those weeks are going be a slight wash, and I have a large final I need to start writing for another class. So this is getting done this weekend, which I thought I was going to have to do before the deadline was changed. If I find I did not meet my goals, I have my wiggle room in the remaining weeks, but I would like to just wrap this up and a call it good.

Saturday - all the design issues fixed. 

Sunday - content revision in the morning, and a proofreading revision in the late afternoon.

Monday - additional proofreading and revision

Friday - Project ready before I leave.
