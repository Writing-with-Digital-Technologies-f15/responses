###DITA Work
In creating my first document using the DITA commands in the Command Prompt on my desktop, I ran into a snag that took myself, Chris and a team member of mine (DITA team, sorry HTML & CSS team!) to completely figure it out.  Apparently it came down to the lack of a quotation mark in, albeit, a very important place.  After that, the submission went much smoother and I was able to add it to the HTML folder, too.  I’m still struggling to completely understand all the elements in reference, though hopefully I can at least get the Concept to come together before class time tomorrow.  What was interesting to me was how many different tasks the Command Prompt seemed to have to run through when converting the DITA file to PDF versus when it was converting it to HTML.  HTML was so un-stressful, aside from just asking myself, “Wait, did it do anything?”
From what I can tell on the reference document is that I probably just have way too many elements, and not all the right ones.  Some I took from the DITA Best Practices book, and some I took from the examples on Github.  But for when I do get it ready for “publishing” I think I want to do a better job of using it in the right way.  So much of Best Practices mentioned, and rightly so, that these documents should be used for the right purposes.  Do not include information in a Concept, for example, which serves the same purpose as what you might include in Task.

###Historicizing Tasks
- Over next week: look into more early web discussion of fonts.  Sarah mentions the tag, which is probably a crucial piece of the history which I glossed over.
As pointed out by Cindy, add more of the critical terms to the site.
- Week after that- work on the more historicizing analysis.  Include context in the early-class readings and different ways I can relate it to those.
- Final week- get better organization and style on the site.  Finish up the content with further clarification on the important aspects of Font already covered.
