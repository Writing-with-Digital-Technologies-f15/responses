## Writing with DITA

	I learned this week that writing for DITA is actually quite fun. It’s even more exciting to see content that’s mine rendered in different formats using the same files. I’m looking forward to applying the practices to my own project.
My coding in DITA got off to a bit of a rocky start. My task topic wasn’t rendering despite the fact that I had the correct syntax for what was causing the problem in class. The message I got was something about “can’t read file” so I thought maybe my problem was that Notepad++ doesn’t save in XML format. I found some plugins that would allow that to happen and got them installed and working properly. One helpful aspect of these plugins is that they provide error feedback when trying to save the file. It would save something anyway, so I tried to run it through the DITA tools and got more errors. Not particularly surprising I suppose, but the two error messages weren’t the same. However, between the two of them, I was able to determine that my tags weren’t opened and closed properly.
	Writing the concept topic and getting it rendered went smoothly. I didn’t have problems with this one, but the reference topic gave me some problems. I got it written OK, but when I tried to render HTML with DITA, I got more error messages. When I looked at a reference topic example in the Bellamy book, I noticed some items that were missing around the line number where I was getting the message. The reference file I used from the examples didn’t have section elements, so when I added these it worked. I’m not sure why I was having this problem when the example rendered OK. Is it because I used a list instead of a table?

## Historicizing Timeline:
	By the end of 11/15, I want to have at least one Reveal.js slide made. The slide will an image so that I know I can add these.  I want to have the layout and order of the rest planned.
I could use some help with making my slides. I’ve download the template from Git and pasted the html into my text editor, but the content is just stacked – doesn’t look like slides at all. I think there’s something that’s not working with the css sheets. My historicizing project is also no longer recognizing the css. 

	By the end of 11/22, I want to have the rest of my slides made.
    
	Between 11/22 and 12/4, I will make any additional tweaks that may be necessary.
