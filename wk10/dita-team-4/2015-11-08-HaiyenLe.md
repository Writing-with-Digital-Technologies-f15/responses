## DITA writing commentary
Writing a concept topic was something that I did not find particularly difficult, but I can see where in some situations it can be. Perhaps I chose too simple of a simple topic to write up in DITA for a concept, though I do wish I could have incorperated some elements like figures and subsections for it. Copy and pasting made the process easy, but in a way, it was a little tedious since my keyboard and I seem to not always work well together. Typoes were bound to happen. Writing the reference topic was a bit trickier for me. Mainly, I had difficulty understanding how to do the table element, like if it was meant to be exactly like HTML's table element or was there some nuanced difference to it. Thankfully, there were online resources to help with that.

The most difficult thing for me, and is still a challenge, is understand how to exactly "publish" the DITA and DITA map into pdf and html5 formats. I was able to follow along with Chris in class until the error occurred, but my brain has blanked out it since then, and this time the Internet isn't being quite as helpful. I think I might just want to go to Chris' office hours to figure it out firsthand, or through an email.
