## Writing with DITA
_Discuss what you learned about writing with DITA: any boundaries that you encountered and overcame, new questions that emerged, etc._

I found that this week was much easier than last week. Going over an example of posting DITA in class was really beneficial to my understanding. The only major issues I had was coming up with topics for my reference and concept. However, I looked at the examples posted for class (monkeys) and was able to find some examples online that were helpful. 

My posts are definitely not very fancy and I'm sure it would have been more difficult if I had made the posts more complex. I made an unordered list which at this point is wicked simple to do, but I didn't add too many other stylistic elements.

I think that I've successfully "published" as pdf as I have a pdf and html5 out folder that I set up in the terminal. This folder is in my computer's "github" folder, but I'm not seeing the folder on github and it's not popping up as an "uncommitted change" for me to push.

##Revisions to Historicizing Website

I think the biggest roadblock that I am having with my historicizing site is that I don't find anything particularly remarkable or novel about the theoretical readings we  have done in class. I am finding it difficult to look at my technology through these frameworks in way that really digs into and whole heartedly commmits to the framework, because I feel sort of foolish doing so. It just seems very obvious to me and sort of like trying to argue that grass is green and the sky is blue. To me, it would make more sense/ be more helpful to the general public for me to write a description of LZW's concrete elements (uses/ how it works/ a little history), then it would to write about how LZW evolved in connection with theoretical xyz. I realize this sounds whiny and I just need to suck it up and dig into Haas et al a little further. I included some theoretical framework in my first draft but it was, admittedly, a half-hearted and not very meaty attempt. 

###Timeline:
11/11: re-read all the course theoretical readings with LZW in mind
by 11/14: make jump links and change the color scheme
by Thanksgiving: rewrite everything within the theoretical framework
use last few days for tweaks/ making it prettier (by 12/4)
