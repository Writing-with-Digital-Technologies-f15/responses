## Response Post
Of the two DITA writing tasks we had this week, I found writing the <'reference'> topic to be more difficult. I didn’t think to check any of the example DITA constructions (monkey, ice cream or remote lighting) to see what a <'reference'> topic should look like, so I didn’t have a good grasp on what kind of information a <'reference'> topic should contain; I went into writing mine mostly blind. (By the way, the remote lighting DITA example has some <'reference'> topics, if anyone reading this was stuck on that too.) I also struggled to think of what would be worthy information about the prose.io writing process to build a topic around, and I settled on explaining the buttons on the writing interface’s toolbar. I ended up finding pointers online that showed me how to form a simple table, and so I hobbled together my <'reference'> topic.

One thing that has tripped me up multiple times over the past week writing with DITA was the amount and placement of the XML tags for certain features. For instance, I wanted to write some sub-steps for some of the steps in my task analysis. After some trial and error, I found that it wasn’t enough to just write <'substep'> to create a sub-step; you have to also have a <'substeps'> tag to contain all the sub-steps for a given step. I had a similar issue at first with creating a simple table. I figured just writing <'simpletable'> like I saw in the Bellamy book wouldn’t work, but I didn’t know how else I could structure it. I was eventually able to overcome these problems by reading more content about DITA, so I guess the only solution here is to dedicate the hours into learning to write with DITA, just as I would with any other system I use.

Revision Timeline
By November 9th: Add minor visual improvements suggested by group comments, find a <'canvas'> game to place on the site
By November 16th: Write an abstract introducing my topic and argument (<'canvas'> invites new groups of people to the web development scene, which changes how the element will continue to develop), add it to site
By November 23rd: Implement 3 practices of platform games in <'canvas'> (visuals, jumping, enemies) as separate pages, create 4th section that compares these to older practices (summarized through _Super Mario Bros._)
By November 30th: Conclusion / implications and finishing visual improvements
By December 4th: Submit my historicizing project
