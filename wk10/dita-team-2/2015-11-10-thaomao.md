##Writing with DITA

My first time writing with DITA was not as difficult as I expected it to be. I read the assigned chapters in the DITA book, which did a great job of describing tags and what types of information to include. I spent more of my time getting sort of familiar with what kinds of tags I could use and how to organize it, which is also something I experienced while writing HTML since I'm not familiar with coding. I spent more time trying to visualize how I wanted to plan out the layout of the practice response topics. 

Without a doubt, the reference and concept topics were the most challenging to write. I had a hard time trying to decide what to write and whether or not the topics should be switched around or not. For the reference topic, I had trouble with trying to format a table. After a lot of time spent searching on the internet, I ended up using an example provided by the Table section in Oasis.

I am still having trouble trying to create the output HTML5 and PDF versions of what I have created. I’m getting a weird error response whenever I try it so it may be due to coding errors. I will have to get this figured out. 

##Revision Timeline

__For my revision timeline, I want to:__

__11/9 – 11/28__
Reexamine Haas’ argument about old and new relationship – I think this is especially important to strengthening my argument. 

__11/29 – 12/3__
Add visual elements to my site – I only included content in my prototype. 
Add functioning links – added content and headings but did not format links to work. I received some pretty helpful tips on how to get this working. 
Go over entire project and make sure everything is up to par.

__12/4__
Submit final version
