#DITA
I am starting to understand DITA a little better this week. It really helps to go through some things step-by-step in class. I thought writing the concept was easy enough, but the reference was more difficult. In the reading I saw there are a lot of different ways you could do the reference section i.e. through unordered lists, tables, section with different titles, etc. I thought about doing a table, but it was kind of confusing so I decided against it for now. 

I have not figured out how to publish the DITA and DITA map into the different PDF/HTML formats. I was trying to look at other peopleâ€™s posting and only a few have done this. Also, I am still unsure about the meaning of some tags or how to use them. 

#Historicizing Project Timeline
The main thing I need to work on for my project is coming up with an argument. A lot of my project currently is just outlining what Flexbox is. 

**Week 10** 
- Look at different readings in class to find a potential theoretical framework. Will use Diliger and Brosset for this. Need to figure out where to put my theoretical framework in project i.e. in history section or its own section. 
- Divide different topics into separate pages. Right now everything is on one page and it is too much content for one page.
- Finish creating codepens for terminology page. I wanted to create a codepen for the majority of my terminology page so people can see what each Flexbox property actually does. 

**Week 11**
- Create the theoretical framework page/section based on findings.
- Restructure page(s) to make content more readable and visually appealing. Currently my text is in small boxes, but I am going to change the text to fill up more of the page. I also had a suggestion to divide my sections better so instead of just having headings for each section I am coloring the page differently. I am not using an framework for my project like bootstrap so I will just do this all manually.

**Week 12**
- Double check all of my coding and fix anything that needs to be fixed.
- Have a peer look at website on another computer to see if everything looks how it is supposed to. I am still trying to figure out how to put my own fonts on the website and have other people be able to see it.
- Possibly create folders for images on site.
