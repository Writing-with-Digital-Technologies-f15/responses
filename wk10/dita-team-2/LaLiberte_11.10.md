## DITA
Working with DITA this week was super interesting! I think last week's videos were a helpful addition to the book, in both visualizing what a complete DITA document looks like and learning a little more about DITA's rigid structure (as in, this element must be inside this element).

I've done quite a bit of table-work in HTML, so it's been interesting to see how that transfers (and doesn't) into working on tables in DITA.

I also got a few "extra" bits of feedback in Terminal when I asked for a PDF output. (Warnings about fonts?) It could be because I don't have an associated style sheet, but then again, I don't have a style sheet for the HTML5 output, either. It still spat out a functional PDF, so DITA seems a little less unforgiving. (Chris, let me know if you'd like to take a look at my Terminal's response...it's almost certainly me.)
