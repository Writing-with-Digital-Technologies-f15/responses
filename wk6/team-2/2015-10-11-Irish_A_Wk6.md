_COYIER, CHRIS. “A Complete Guide to Flexbox.” CSS-Tricks. 9 Sept. 2015. Web. 11 Oct. 2015.  https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/._

This article was originally written in 2013, but is still being consistently updated. The last update was only last month of this year. The reason for the consistent update is that is a reference source to many users of flexbox and it keeps up to date with the module’s changes. It goes over the basic and more complex terminology of flexbox and its many uses including coded examples. A few of the uses the article mentions are: perfect centering, redistributing grid elements without media queries, creating responsive columns with a fixed header and foot, and creating responsive design across different device platforms. 

_CSS Working Group Wiki. 7 Jan. 2015. Web. 11 Oct. 2015. https://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css3-flexbox#issue-2._

This is part of the CSS Working Group’s Wiki and it goes through flexbox’s specification issues and planning. It includes a spec syntax property map to shows the spec changes between the 2009 draft and current draft. This Wiki goes through the history of flexbox by detailing 19 resolved issues of flexbox linking to the original proposal to fix the issue. It also has open issues such as terminology and naming. Some of the issues located under the open issues section have been close or resolved, as the site keeps up to date. 

## Memo

My aim for the historicizing project is to trace the history of flexbox beginning with its first draft in 2009 to today and look at the inference of its current uses. A few of the sources I have looked at presume flexbox should be used for smaller projects or not for an overall web design. I think it will help to compare flexbox to the grid. One of my sources compared the two in relation to their rendering and complications, but I want to search more for when and why you would use one or the other. 

Initial projects aims:
- Intended purpose of flexbox creation
- How flexbox is currently being used
- Future uses of flexbox with continuing development and support
- Compare specs of initial draft and current module
- Comparison of flexbox to grid
- Its role in relative web design

I decided this weekend to switch to flexbox as my historicizing project topic and would look some additional suggestions about what to look at for the project or some commentary on my initial suggestions. I thought about looking at the use of flexbox for app design or mobile website design due to its responsive features, but I have not found enough information on this yet so it is not in my initial aims.  As I find more sources and get more into the topic I will learn more about its uses.
