This is the original article the creator of the LZW wrote for the IEEE’s computer publication in June of 1984. The article introduces the compression algorithm as a method that will recode data to remove redundancy through conventions not found in preexisting methods. Welch describes how the LZW algorithm side steps problems that older compression systems faced with redundancy and being too specific to certain types of data. LZW is a noiseless compression system where the compressed data will mirror the initial input data once decompressed. Welch details the different types of data redundancies—character distribution, repetition, high-usage patterns, positional redundancy and how previous compression methods insufficiently addressed these issues.

The patent for the LZW compression method provides an extremely detailed description of how the compression method works, preexisting methods of compression, patents for other soft and hard technologies that reference the original patent, and preexisting patents that were cited in the patent for Welch’s LZW. The document also includes a history of legal events associated with the patent, with dates and current ownership information (Polaroid Corporation).


#Memo

I aim to historicize the LZW Compression method beginning with the filing of Lempel & Ziv’s patent in 1981 that acted as a precursor for Welch’s LZW method and working up to Gif Fiasco of the 1990s when Unisys (patent holder) attempted to collect thousands of dollars for people using the LZW compression method in GIF files, and the ultimate expiration of the patent that has made LZW free again.

My initial project aims are to describe:
+ the issues motivating the invention of LZW
+ how the LZW compression method works
+ what future patents LZW contributed to
+ the relationship between LZW and GIFs
+ the current role of LZW

I initially thought that I would focus on hexadecimal code, but decided that that was too broad of a topic. I am very interested in encryption methods and think that LZW is particularly interesting because the name itself historicizes the invention—the LZ come from the previous inventors (Lempel & Ziv) and the W comes from Welch, the man who adapted LZW into its current form.
