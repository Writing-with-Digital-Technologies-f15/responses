This article provides a brief but thorough history of GIF, starting with what influenced the development of GIF to current times. The article links the beginnings of GIF with fascination towards moving images and then moves to the creation of GIF in 1987. The article summarizes major points after the development of GIF such as the patent scandal, how it has been used (Geocities), and ending with GIFs popularity today. Overall, Eppink provides an adequate summary of the history of GIF. He highlights interesting and important points throughout the lifespan of GIF.

The article provides more insight into one specific issue: the controversy surrounding the patenting of the LZW technique, which has to do with data compression, and the resulting outrage within the technology community. Battilana analyzes why it was so problematic and how it eventually resulted in the creation of PNG in an attempt to replace GIF and be free of use. 

###Memo

The aim of my project is to examine how GIFs have affected communication. The historicizing project needs to cover two points: political and rhetorical movements that have motivated development and how it has been shaped by print media. I would like to look into what led to the development of GIF and then any issues that have prompted changes to it, and how GIFs have changed how we communicate. 

During my research, I’ve noted down some interesting points of interest that I would like to possibly center my project around:
•	Why are GIFs so popular
o	This could include why it’s so prevalent in social media and how it has affected communication.
•	GIF v. PNG
•	What led to development of GIF
o	What are the politics/rhetoric behind its development and any changes that were made to it.
•	LZW patent
