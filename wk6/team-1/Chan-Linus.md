##Memo

I originally aimed to focus on Flash for my historicizing project. However, I've come to realize that the topic was far too broad. Still, I was interested in the communities that developed from flash. Therefore, I'm starting to re-position my research to reflect the history of the comment element <!>. It's a tiny bit meta, but i'm curious to see as to how the formation of communication began and how it's beginning to change in HTML as well as across the web. 

The first block that I plan to develop is the era of documentation in the internet. I'm interested in how it started, how it developed as well as how documentation has changed based off of the community that was focused on it. As the web became more and more commercialized, has the content of the comment elements become less and less personalized? 

The second block that I would like to work on is the use of comments in our modern era of coding. A good coder is often judged by their use of comments within their code. Whether these comments are clear, they make sense and whether they enable a new person to understand what the code actually does. Are there models that people follow in the use of their comments? When a person creates a website, do comments often follow Title tags, article tags and section tags? Did the W3 set up a standard by which we're supposed to follow? 

The last block is one that is still a little bit fuzzy. Recently, I've seen web communities that have stopped using comment boxes, (Which I understand are very different from the element, but they still seem to share some similiarities). That which was almost ubiquitous in the internet is now being put to a stop. When commenting on a code, it's generally felt as innocous. It harms no one and it help the reader understand the code better. In fact, it helps the author personalize the website that they created. However, as content creators seem to be turning off comment applications, i'm curious if this will spread to code as well.
