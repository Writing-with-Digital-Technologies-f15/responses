### The CSS Saga

A separate document pertaining to the structure of a document's layout had been a goal ever since HTML was first created. CSS first made an appearance in 1994, as electronic publishing, such as newspapers, began happening on the Web and developers realized there was no way to style these publishings. There were many proposed style langauges (for example, Pei Wei's language and DSSSL), but what made CSS different was that the style of a document on the Web could not be designed by either the author or the reader. Instead, their preferences had to be combined, or "cascaded," taking into account the display device and browser as well.

### Why Use CSS?

CSS allows you to define styles for documents, such as design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. Advantages for using CSS include: helping avoid duplication; making maintenanc easier; and allowing you to make a changes for the entire site in once place.

## Memo

My project will focus on how CSS has developed over the years and its effect on document design for the web. To narrow it down, there are two ways I can go with this. One, I could look at the effects of CSS on documents in a particular field, such as medical documentation. Or two, I could look at a particular style element within CSS and how it affects the design layout of documents on the Web.
