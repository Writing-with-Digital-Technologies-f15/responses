## Source Annotations
Note: I chose these two articles because they gave me more subtance than just the explanation of the element from a giant list of elements, as helpful they are for understand their purpose in HTML. These galso gave me some insight into what I can discuss about this element with its semantic and non-semantic uses.

### Annotation:
This article is from a Germany-based online magzine for web designers and developers. It not only covers &lt;blockquote&gt;, but the &lt;cite&gt; and &lt;q&gt; elements as well, as they fall under this umbrella of elements with the purpose of semantically marking up quotations in text. The main of this article is how to use the blockquote element effectively, hence best practices. Lennartz's article provides visual examples of how the blockquote element can be used in practical contexts while stile sticking to its core principle for quotations. Links to tutorials from other sources for CSS and how to use quotes for web page design are also in this article. This is more of a design-oriented source that isn't as strict on how the blockquote element should be used particularly, aside from one real-life example presenting how the blockquote can be misused for introductory text to a web page. However, they do make a point on how the blockquotes are semantically ifferent from block quotes and pull quotes, something they do want the reader to recognize.

### Annotation:
Studiopress is a company who sells pressionally-designed themes for WordPress. They also have resources for readers, including design and WordPress tips. This author puts an emphasis on &lt;blockquote&gt; being used according to how it was semantically intended: to mark up a quotation from an outside source. While this would exlude pull quotes, which are from within the source and meant for emphasis, the article suggests another element that can be used for pull quotes, the &lt;aside&gt; element. According to the Mozilla Develope Network, the description of this element is as follows:

> The HTML &lt;aside&gt; element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content. These sections are often represented as sidebars or inserts. They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions from the glossary; there may also be other types of information, such as related advertisements; the biography of the author; web applications; profile information or related links on the blog.

Back onto the topic of the article, it frovites a bulleted list on how to use the blockquote element in a semantically correct fashion, and advice on how to determine whether to use the blockquote or the aside element. Their suggestions for blockquote usage lends it to be not as fanciful within the content, such as advising the font size used for blockquotes to not be larger than the rest of the text. There's a brief explanation on why the semantic correctness is important, but they also do not end off the article without providing usable CSS for blockquotes.

## Historicizing Memo
What I'm going to initially aim for with my historicizing project is understanding the usage of &lt;blockquote&gt; on the web both correctly and incorrectly according to semantic rules, and including the literary context behind both and why it's used as such. Both citations and pull quotes are valuable elements to writing, but in different areas of writing are their roles more prominent. A claim I think I want to make is that there are factors to why blockquote is used so diversely, despite semantic correctness. One I do know is that it's a common feature on many text editors, including prose.io and , which don't require in depth knowledge of HTML and CSS to use it. There's also how well it works with CSS, bringing in the concept of text design and visual rhetoric, which ties in with the pull quote treatment.

### Aims (now in bulleted list form)
- intended purpose of &lt;&gt; according to html and its properties (HTML and CSS)
- how it's used on the web currently, regardless of semantics
- current obscurity/diminishing presence of the blockquote in print (including matters of citation in documents)
- perceived rhetorical value of pull quotes in news stories and articles, as well as in commercial website design (testimonials are often put in blockquotes)
- application of the contexts from the above two bullets to understand blockquote's varied usage
- relation to Haas's chapters from her book about technology's own lack of self-determination and transparency despite the myths.

For the third and fourth bullets I have found some articles through EBSCO Host that gave me the idea for those two aims, and it helps to have a slightly broader umbrella to research material for this project. They're also related to the idea of writing practices that has to be involved in this project, which is also convenient.
