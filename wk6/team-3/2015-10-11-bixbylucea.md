I chose the element Center for my project.

This website seems like it was designed to help people who are new to HTML understand the building blocks that make up code. This specific page describes the function of block elements and then lists quite a few different elements and explains what each of them does and how to use them, with examples. There is a particular section for the element Center, which used to be able to be used in the middle of a paragraph to center any bit of text. The page briefly goes into Center’s history: it was introduced by Netscape/NHTML before being adopted by W3C. The section that follows describes Div, and explains that (at least at the time) alignment was also a Div attribute. So you could center an entire Div section by using Center as an attribute.

I was excited to find this source, which seems to be email messages between people who were involved in the development of HTML or at least were commenting on its development. At this point, Center was not part of HTML, and Tony Sanders explains in his message his viewpoint that adding Center would not be particularly helpful. He doesn’t want HTML to get too cluttered, for fear of becoming non-user-friendly. He suggests that, if “presentation cues inside HTML” must be added, it should be in an “organized” fashion rather than just adding random things at random times because people want them. He also asks why we don’t just use style sheets for these “presentation cues,” foreshadowing CSS.  

##Memo 
I decided to choose between my topic ideas by researching which one had the most interesting history about which I could find good sources. Center was the first one I started researching and that was as far as I got because I was so intrigued by what I found! It seems like Center has a surprisingly complex history full of decision making on the part of the creators of Netscape, HTML, and CSS.
In the beginning, Center was developed by Netscape and used in NHTML (still trying to figure out exactly what that is?) before they used Div, in response to popular demand. 
W3C saw how popular design aspects like Center were and grafted it into HTML 3.2. By HTML 4.0, however, they felt it would be better off elsewhere and Center was moved to CSS style sheets. It was deprecated in HTML and currently resides in CSS. 
I would like to dig into those historical steps that led to Center being a part of CSS instead of Netscape or HTML. I have found a few sources from around the time the different versions of HTML were being developed, which leads me to hope that there are more relevant sources still to be uncovered. 
Further, I plan to look more into how Center is used today in CSS. W3.org explains that Center is an attribute of the CSS element text-align, and that things can also be centered vertically using the attribute “Middle” with the element vertical-align as well as through the use of percentages. I will explore some popular website to see if they utilize center or if they prefer to use left align. I would like to find out what the current trends are in terms of text alignment on web pages and it seems like the best way to do that would be to look at some different current, recognizable websites.
