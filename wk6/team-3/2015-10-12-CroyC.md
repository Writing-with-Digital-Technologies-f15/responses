## Annotated sources:

**Source 1**: Edward R. Tufte, The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within, November 2011. (Second printing, first was in 2006)
Tufte discusses how PowerPoint limits the amount of data that can be included on a PowerPoint slide. This limits a user’s ability to do rigorous analysis and give intelligent technical presentations. When I first read this, I didn’t agree with it. However, closer reading convinced me that Tufte has a valid point. In one example, he describes the case of the January 2003 Columbia accident. NASA officials were assessing the threat posed by foam insulation debris breaking off of the space shuttle. Engineers from Boeing attempted to help by providing analysis in the form of PowerPoint slides. However, they did not include any further documentation, so the report was too superficial to convey the threat to the astronauts in the space shuttle. 
In another example, he describes a mortality table from 1662. He compares the number of pairwise comparisons in this table (1,719,585) with the number in 155 PowerPoint slides (10,230). This makes PowerPoint look inferior, but I think anyone trying to make an argument about one of the 1,719,585 comparisons in the mortality table would have to select pertinent data and present it in a smaller table.

**Source 2**: Robert Gaskins, Sweating Bullets: Notes About Inventing PowerPoint, April 2012.
This source is a book written by Robert Gaskins in which he details the challenges he faced when inventing PowerPoint. I haven’t read it closely yet (it’s around 500 pages), but it seems more a story about rescuing a failing company using PowerPoint as a product than it is a story about how he conceived and developed the idea of PowerPoint. In what I have read so far, he states that PowerPoint was intended primarily for business users as a means for them to create overheads and 35mm slides more quickly and cheaply. While not his intention, improvements in technology have allowed PowerPoint to replace these presentation tools.
The original proposal for PowerPoint is included in the book and on a separate web page (http://www.gbuwizards.com/files/gaskins-original-powerpoint-proposal-14-aug-1984.pdf). It is interesting to note that the final product fits his proposal quite well and that some of the uses he intended are the same ones which Tufte criticizes. It will be interesting to see if Gaskins responds to any of Tufte’s criticisms in his book.
## Memo of potential building blocks
Based on these two sources, I see a history of PowerPoint, its intended use, and its inappropriate use as one block. 
Open Source PowerPoint alternatives, their advantages, and who uses them could be another block.
Another block could be the use of the OpenDocument format for the files in these alternatives. Since XML is the basis of the OpenDocument format, how XML creates the format could be part of this block.
