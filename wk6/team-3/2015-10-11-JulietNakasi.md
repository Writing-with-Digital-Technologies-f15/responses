## Sources for my project

1.	http://blog.digitaltutors.com/whats-difference-image-figure-tags-html5/

This article helps me understand the difference between image and figure tags in HTML5. One of the many things that made me choose to historicize figure/figurecaption element was first to figure out if there was a difference between images tag that was used in the HTML versions before and figure tag in HTML5. After figuring out if there was a difference, I wanted to know what the difference was. Therefore, this article explained to me the difference, and how to use both tags in my code. The article also has some more detailed information about the image and figure tags that will be very crucial for me to explain how the figure tag works in connection with the image tag.

The first article talked about the difference between figure and image tags. It didn’t really offer much information about the figurecaption element. Therefore, this article talks about the figure element, and why the figurecaption is necessary, and how it can be added to the figure tag. The article also offers more detailed information about the figurecaption. That information will be important to me when I talk about the origin in the historicizing project.  The article just like the one above also shows how the figure and figurecaption elements can be implemented in the code, and also show examples of how they come out when the page is opened. 

## MEMO

Based off my two sources above, I chose to go with figure/figurecaption elements. My other option was the CSS Reset, which could’ve been a cool and fun project, but finding sources and figuring out how I wanted to do it turned out a little bit hard. Therefore, I decided to do the figure/figurecaption for my historicizing project. I am excited about doing it because I believe there are multiple things I will learn during the entire project.  There are a few things I will focus on throughout this project. 

1.	Showing the difference between image and figure element. The main reason why I chose the figure/figurecaption elements for my project was to figure out if there was really a difference between the images and figure elements. I wanted to know why it was necessary to introduce figure element in HTML5. I think image would have worked fine, but the developers of HTML5 found it necessary to introduce the figure element. I really wanted to know why that was necessary. Therefore, one of the main things I will be doing for my project is showing what the figure element provides that perhaps the image element by itself couldn’t. 

2.	Figurecaption element is another reason why I chose to go with the two elements. I believe figure captions are absolutely helpful, but when I chose this element my question was, “is it necessary to have figure captions every time a figure element is used?”  Therefore, my project will focus a little bit on figuring out some people’s preferences for that.  I know when doing something for schoolwork, figure captions are necessary, but are they really necessary when I am developing a fun page? 

I just decided to go with figure/figurecaption just recently (Saturday night), therefore, I am not yet completely sure how I want to go about this particular project. I know I had a few things that interested me about the project, but I am still trying to get more major claims I can make. If any of the group members have some suggestions, I would gladly appreciate them.
