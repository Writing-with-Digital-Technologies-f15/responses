## HTML & CSS

Writing and understanding HTML was pretty easy. I have never written any codes in HTML, but when I followed Duckett's book, it was easy for me to follow and create the HTML pages. I created the pages in a very short time for my bio. One thing that I still haven't yet figured out how to do in HTML is to make my links to show up on the page once I write them in my HTML file.

CSS on the other hand was very confusing to me. I understand why we need to use it. It makes the pages look better and provides other things. However, it took me a while to figure out how to actually use it in my html code. I followed Duckett's book and did exactly what he said, but it didn't work out for. Therefore, I googled how to write CSS, and got some other expanation. I was able to eventually figure out a few things. For example, changing the font color, background color, text size, and text font. I was also able to figure out how to do a frame with, and without boostrap. Figuring out how to do it with bootstrap was very challenging for me. It took me a very long time to get something simple to work. Overall, writing CSS isn't too hard, but the way to format it into the html is the confusing part. I had the basics down, but I just kept getting confused on how I could actually include it in my html and for it to work. I now know the basics, but I still don't understand it really well.

In the chapters we read this week, Duckett showed us how to use CSS in the html or outside html. I tried both to see if i could get it, but i wasn't able to get anything to work when I put it outside. I got it to work in between my html. I played around with the different things that are suggested in the book.
