## A New Post
I have uploaded four web pages. They represent different steps in my quest to get css working. The first is the base html without any styling. The second is using the Pure css framework. The third is putting the styling within the html files, and the last is using an external css file to apply the styling. 
The Pure framework still seems a bit “automagic” to me at this point. I downloaded the file the Pure website created for me and pasted my code into it. It certainly made a change, but I’m don’t know how to get Pure to make the same changes I made manually. I’m thinking from the way it’s written that Pure’s developers left a stylesheet on Yahoo’s site, but it wasn’t readable. None of the sheets I downloaded from Pure is remotely readable. Some don’t appear to even have anything in them. If they were more readable, maybe I could get a better idea of what they actually do. 
When I was trying to apply the styling with my own stylesheet, nothing happened at first. Since I didn’t know if this was because my instructions were bad or because the css file was not being accessed, I pasted the styling into the HTML file. Since it did turn the text red like I wanted, I figured that part of my problem was due to the way I had the css written. After making several changes, I finally got it right. Then I copied all of this into the stylesheet file. The styling was not applied until the stylesheet file and the HTML file were in the same folder. 
The writing practices from this assignment, and the readings, reminded me of several things I have experienced in other situations. With respect to writing technologies, I’ve learned from this assignment, and other computer use, that details are very important. If you don’t have a hyphen present (as in font-size), the changes don’t happen. I’ve noticed this to be true in many computer applications. If the command is not perfect, the computer can’t understand what is wanted, so we have learned to write very precisely for these types of technologies. 
The concept of “stylesheet” is another that I’ve encountered before. Three different classes have had three different definitions of a stylesheet. They’re all related, but slightly different. For editing, a stylesheet defines how terms, formatting, and spelling should be used so they are consistent throughout a document or project. For Microsoft Word, a stylesheet consists of all the styles and formatting present in a particular Word document. This is the most similar to stylesheets as used in css except the document is HTML instead of Word. There is a commonality in the practice of using stylesheets in different writing practices. 
Another practice that reminded me of a similar concept from another area of life is the order of how css rules cascade. It reminds me of order of operations in math. If order of operations in math or rules cascade in css isn’t standardized, nothing in math or css would be predictable. This seems a clear example of a practice arising from cultural knowledge.
