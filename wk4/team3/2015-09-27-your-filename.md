## Uff da: CSS by hand and with Pure.css

Wow, this was an interesting assignment! I'm going to continue tweaking my websites, as I'm not super happy with either of them.

I decided to start by trying CSS without a framework, to get the harder stuff out of the way. While I could figure out how to edit pieces of my site, heavily referencing Duckett, it lacked... flair. Youth. Non-90s styling. Changing one bit of CSS, and watching something work or fall apart, was an interesting learning experience. Without any CSS, all the styling was automatic, so if a paragraph missed a p tag, you couldn't really tell. But once I started changing the colors of text, boy, could you ever. Starting from the CSS of the section where styling wasn't as intended, I had to work through every CSS and HTML element until I found my hanging tags—annoying, to be sure, but a valuable lesson in care.

When I moved on to framework CSS, I was really excited. Responsive design! Pretty sections! I couldn't figure out how to get the `<link a href="pure.io.css">` stylesheet to work, so I ended up downloading the starter kit. I'm also not positive I could figure out how to put a stylesheet in a separate file on github and pull from it, but I might mess around with that Monday, because I <em>think</em> that was the intent of the assignment instructions. What I ended up doing was inserting the pure.css style using the internal `<style>` tag, which worked...okay. I still haven't followed through every bit of pure CSS, to match up the titles of their content/header/footer/menu sections with mine, which will be important to get pure CSS to work as intended. It would probably have been easier to start from the pure CSS framework from scratch, without any dividing tags, so everything was titled correctly. Again, I might walk through that properly tomorrow.

As a result of this class, I've modified and expanded my definition of "content." Before, I simply considered it the metaphorical water in a glass, or the substance in a container. This understanding was partially due to my writing courses, where content is often text-focused, and the colloquial use of "content" particular to my job at CLA, where my discussions clearly separate user-provided "content" with the content managment system's structure. Now, the word content can be used differently—as a tag, a title, or a note-to-self. I had originally used "content" as a `<section class="">` designator, but when I tried out the pure framework, they were (apparently) using the content title with `<div class="">`. That threw off some of my brain-Text Wrangler coordination, and made for a confusing 1-1 comparison between my HTML and the pure CSS. In this way, my recent understanding and use of "content" came into conflict with pure's new (to me) use of "conflict," as well as the use of "content" I was familiar with before this class. In a very micro way, my writing task was shaped by the technology, knowledge, and skills described as the makeup in writing practice in Scribner and Cole's book.
