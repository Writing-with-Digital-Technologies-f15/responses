## Writing with CSS
	I had several takeaways from writing with CSS itself.  After writing with html, it is really interesting to me how they work in tandem.  I’ve mentioned before that what struck me about the evolution and “unbroken thread” of html was that it was a language.  If CSS is another language, then how it works with html is really interesting.  In order to communicate to the browser what we would like it to convey, at least in a more complex manner, we need to be able to “speak” each of these languages.  But at the same time, the languages are very much a technology, and have to be treated as such. Technologies, like languages, all have mechanics and rules which they follow.  
CSS itself is a set of rules for the more base language of html.  Given that it is a set of rules, and having the ability to work on our own in this medium, we as the site-designers are given a lot of power over what our html does.  If we didn’t want it to be hard to adapt to the CSS rules, then that’s how we design the CSS rules.  But if we didn’t have a lot of thought towards the flexibility of our site to begin with when writing the html, adjusting it will probably bring about much more satisfying results.

## Writing with Pure.css
	Having a framework to work with was a little more liberating, because people whose job it is to design site layouts were giving me access to their ideas.  I think I like being told what I should do, so that part appealed to me, but there was also a lot of freedom within the framework to give your own ideas life.

## Thoughts on Mediation	
	This whole process made me realize how we really do have to know so many social constructs to communicate through writing.  Whatever we’re writing is hardly ever purely a product of the fact that we can put letters down on paper, or on a digital document.  What this made me realize, too, is that there are a lot of different levels to what that means.  There are the skills, which we’re learning in this class (and they can be very challenging), and there are the social constructs- but sometimes those overlap in the realm of writing.  Such as, it’s a skill to be able to put together a certain type of list on the web, but there’s also the skill of know which type of list you want to use and why.  Writing itself draws its need from these type of situations.
