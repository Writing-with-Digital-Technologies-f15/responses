## Writing in CSS
I have never done anything with CSS before so I just started off the assignment by trying to understand the basic concepts of it. To begin the assignment, I started out without using bootstrap or pure.css and just began to add in different CSS elements. I played around mostly with colors, fonts, and adding boxes around the headers and paragraphs. I had some trouble trying to figure out aligning the text where I wanted it and the paragraphs. 

Chapter 13 was interesting to me because of all the different options for creating boxes around the text. It seemed like an easy way to transform the look of your webpage. For my **h1** header outset border style. I used the box shadow for the paragraphs. I wanted to use the border-radius element on my image, which I thought would be cool to use with on a larger webpage using it on borders for links, sections, and images.  

The hardest thing I found with writing CSS is keeping it organized. I decided to insert notes into my code so that I can find each section I had written something for.  

## Pure CSS
I choose to use pure CSS for the framework. I was not sure what pure CSS was versus bootstrap, but when I was looking at each of the pages I choose pure CSS because it seemed like it would be easier or at least more flexible. 

It took me awhile to get the code to work with what I wanted. The problem I faced here was I kept trying to get my two paragraphs next to each other but it was not working because I had them in separate `<section>` elements. There are a lot of cool features with pure CSS. I added in the `pure-button` feature for my links but I also considered using the menu option. I really like the simplicity of pure CSS. 

The only problem I had that I did not resolve was my webpage was my paragraphs overlapping. I used jsbin to view the site as I was coding it and if my webpage is fully extend (opened up on full-screened webpage) than it looks normal, but I did not figure out how to make the units relative or have breakpoints. 

I think pure CSS is very useful to making a webpage look nice because it is easier to get the layout you want with only a view extra lines of code here and there. I think my lack of CSS knowledge made this assignment harder for me. Even though pure CSS is supposed to be simple the explanations of each element such as grids and buttons were not thorough enough for me to get right away and it was more of a guess-and-check method when coding it.

## Practice Account of Writing
I think CSS help gives your page context. Earlier we discussed how webpages represent real-world documents such as a newspaper. The framework for a webpage is important and in my webpage I chose to put the personal and professional bio next to each other so that they are equal. If one was at the top of the page and the other at the bottom it may have a different context. Although we did not have much to work with for our webpage, I can see how larger webpages would really want to take advantage of the framework.
