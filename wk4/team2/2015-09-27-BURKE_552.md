## Week 4 CSS Exercise
When I started to write CSS without the framework, I wasn’t sure of how a CSS file was supposed to be drafted and what kinds of commands to type to manipulate and position the HTML code. Luckily I had a CSS file saved from a project in a web design class I took two semesters ago, so I was able to pick up the basics from that. As I wrote some basic CSS for my sample website in this class, I gradually regained and built upon some of the knowledge I picked up from that web design class. I experimented with values and keywords to see if I could position my content just the way I wanted to. I might even say I enjoyed returning to writing CSS. It was fun to revisit the topic and see what I remembered or could pick up quickly. However, I found I couldn’t do some things even with my notes and examples to fall back on. For instance, I never learned the CSS line that removes the bullet points from unordered lists. For issues like that, I had to search for the answer online.

With the Pure.CSS framework and some of the table-making tips I gleaned from the website, I found it much easier to arrange my text, and I was more pleased with the results as well. Working earlier without the framework, I felt limited to placing text only on the far sides or the very center with the text-align tag Although I had worked with tables and div tags in my web designer class, I had used Adobe Dreamweaver as an interface to develop the code. This was my first time working with these elements directly. I enjoyed getting the chance to see what exactly I had been working before and learning more about this important aspect of web design.

As for how CSS fits into the practice framework of our culture, how our “recurrent and goal-directed writing activities” mold CSS, I think the ‘responsive design’ provided by CSS links well with usability and the work of technical writers and communicators. Both attempt to keep complicated technological concepts simple and easy to understand or work with for the end user. The endeavor to explain things simply and clearly is a long-running goal of technical writing, and I see responsive design as playing a similar role for CSS and web page design.
