I didn't know anything about CSS before this week's readings. So I found Duckett's chapters to be really helpful with beginning to use CSS. I didn't create a separate stylesheet, since the biography website is very simple overall, I included CSS within the HTML document using the style tag. Once I had this figured out, it was an interesting experience to try out some of the design options Duckett brings up. I played around with some functions. I changed the background color, font type, font sizing, and I also added borders. 

I decided to use Pure.css for my framework. Overall, I didn't find Pure.css to be a helpful framework compared to just adding my own CSS. I think this could be because I am not familiar with CSS. I browsed Pure.css and looked at some of the options it had, such as grids, layouts, and buttons. I decided to use a table format to hold my contact information. It didn't look too different from the original list format. I tried using the grids, but I didn't really understand how to use it. Something I noticed about Pure.css is that it didin't mention anything about typography. Whereas Bootstrap does, which could have been quite helpful too.

Overall, writing CSS was a challenge. Being able to actually put it to use is harder than just reading about it. It was also very eye opening to be able to see how changign or adding CSS could completely change the layout of a site. And how much of a difference font size, padding, and margins can make text so much easier to read. 

CSS allows us to customize content that would suit our intended audience. This can come in many forms, such as responsive design, where a website can adjust to different screen sizes. Duckett also devotes some time to this topic; he discusses how boxes can be used to prevent overlapping of text and providing more structure (p. 306). I think this is more relevant now because there are many types of technology that we can use to access the web. Responsive design also goes hand-in-hand with usability. Intended to provide the best user experience based on the type of technology used.
