I didn’t know anything about CSS or coding prior to this. So I found Duckett’s chapters to be really helpful with beginning to use CSS. I didn’t create a separate stylesheet. Since the biography website is very simple overall, I thought it would be more effective to just include CSS within the HTML using the <style> tag. Once I had this figured out, it was an interesting experience to try out some of the design options Duckett brings up. 


I decided to use Pure.css for my framework. Overall, I didn’t find Pure to be as helpful of a framework compared to just adding my own CSS. I think this could be because I am not familiar with CSS. I used a table format from Pure to hold my contact information. It didn’t look too different from the original list format. 


Another thing I noticed about Pure.css is it didn’t have anything about formatting colors, text, and background. I looked at Bootstrap and saw that it had information on typography, which would have been very helpful. 


CSS allows us to customize content that would suit our intended audience. This can come in many forms, such as responsive design, where website to adjust to different screen sizes. Duckett also devotes some time to this topic; he discusses how boxes can be used to prevent overlapping of text and providing more structure (p. 306). I think this is more relevant now because there are many types of technology that we can use to access the Internet. CSS and HTML also has a lot to do with usability, making something that would be easy for users to use.
