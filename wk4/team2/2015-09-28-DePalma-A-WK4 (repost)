## Insights into CSS
While I had used HTML in past courses (flashback to middle school web page design), I had never used CSS before this week. Therefore, my experience with CSS has been very challenging.

I'll start by discussing Duckett's chapters. While I find Duckett's style to be very clear and easy to understand and certainly helpful, I learn more from looking at full fledged examples. Before I added my CSS elements to my page, I spent some time looking at sample code online. While my page isn't that glamorous (the snapchats Anna sent me of hers looked a lot nicer than mine), I was able to set the font, size, and color, format my image,and add a background.

The biggest challenge I had with CSS was probably keeping my code coherent and remembering to properly close out lines. I think this is something that I will get better at with time. I played around a bit with color before settling on a pretty tame blue pallette. I used the "3D" grooved border for my main tile and thought that the border elements were a good way to showcase important aspects of the page. Personally, I like when webpages are straightforward and simple so I tried to keep mine clear.

##Pure CSS

I decided to use pure.css for my framework mostly becasue the bootstrap funciton is the name of a monstrous function in statistics and I just didn't want to go near something that evoked horrible memories of trying to get the bootstrap code to run in R... Anyways: I don't think I fully comprehend pure.css, but I think it would be more useful/ easily understood with a larger webpage. I added buttons to my page for the links. I had some trouble with this at first, but it was a stupid syntax error on my part. I think the buttons are a good way to highlight clickable content. One thing I've noticed while personally navigating the web is that sometimes links don't stand out enough to command traffic. I think the buttons are a good way to ensure that a user knows that the content will direct them elsewhere. I ran into a problem with lines of text overlapping each other, but I was able to resolve it. I think that for a project as small as this, pure css isn't fully necessary because the page is small enough not to need a framework (?), but I could be missing the point entirely.

CSS was more challenging than I had anticipated, but also definitely improved the appearance and readability of the page, so I see why it's important.

## Practice Account

I am taking this as a sort of a "how does CSS fit into the writing with digital technologies ecosystem". Following this vein, I think that zooming in on the way that CSS optimizes user experience is fitting. CSS is both scalable and "responsive" and allows for stylistic changes to be made that make the document not only more visually appealing, but more readable. The need for CSS is obvious even when working with a smaller page, but I think that the need for pure css would be more tangible if I was building a larger site. Pure CSS can also help with the scalability of the page because by setting up the architecture ahead of time, the administrator could launch large or small scale changes with a greater ease.
