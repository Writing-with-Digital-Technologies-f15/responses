#Insights into CSS (ahhh)

While I had used HTML in past courses (flashback to middle school web page design), I had never used CSS before this week. Therefore, my experience with CSS has been very challenging.

I'll start by discussing Duckett's chapters. While I find Duckett's style to be very clear and easy to understand and certainly helpful, I learn more from looking at full fledged examples. Before I added my CSS elements to my page, I spent some time looking at sample code online. While my page isn't that glamorous (the snapchats Anna sent me of hers looked a lot nicer than mine), I was able to set the font, size, and color, format my image,and add a background. 

I decided to use pure.css for my framework mostly becasue the bootstrap funciton is the name of a monstrous function in statistics and I just didn't want to go near something that evoked horrible memories of trying to get the bootstrap code to run in R... Anyways: I don't think I fully comprehend pure.css, but I think it would be more useful/ easily understood with a larger webpage. I am currently trying to add a button to my page (it's not working and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong). I think that for a project as small as this, pure css isn't fully necessary because the page is small enough not to need a framework (?), but I could be missing the point entirely.

My biggest issue with CSS is that it woulnd't let me use Gotham, but I can probably find a workaround if I watch a few youtube videos. CSS was more challenging than I had anticipated, but also definitely improved the appearance and readability of the page so I see why it's important. 

I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "I expect you to apply the conceptual framework surrounding mediation and a practice account of writing", so I am taking it as a sort of "how does CSS fit into the writing with digital technologies ecosystem". Following this vein, I think that zooming in on the way that CSS optimizes user experience is fitting. CSS is both scalable and "responsive" and allows for stylistic changes to be made that make the document not only more visually appealing, but more readable.
