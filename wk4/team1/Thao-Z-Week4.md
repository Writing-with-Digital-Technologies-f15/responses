I first heard of and used CSS when I took a web design class, but even then I only used it to change the font of my body and I think the background of my webpage. I know that there is a lot that I can use CSS for when coding for a website, however, it is the one item I still have yet to fully understand how to use and how to incorporate into a website. For this assignment, I went with pure.css.

When I first opened pure.css, I didn't know what to do afterwards. To start with, I inserted my information where it needed to go, and noticed that the font style from pure.css was applied to my bio. From there, things went downhill though, and eventually I realized I wasn't getting anywhere anymore. Part of it could be that I just was not understanding how to use pure.css though. I don't know whether I was supposed to be using the style under "Inspect Elements," and if I was, I didn't know how to commit the changes. I think if I knew how to fully use pure.css, the experience I had wouldn't have been so frustrating. 

As of right now, I am content with using an internal style sheet. It's right there with my code, and I find it the easiest to access. I'm sure that after I learn more about CSS  though and finally understand how to use an external style sheet correctly, I'll find those more helpful.
