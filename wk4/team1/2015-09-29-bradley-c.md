Using CSS

For this assignment I dedcided to use Purecss because the Boostrap application had a lot more language that I was unfamiliar with. I began to insert CSS into my biography page mainly by changing the background color and the font color. I have playing around with the addition of boxes and grids, and while I was able to form a box, my text dissapeared. My biggest issue was merging the html and the css text, and understanding how they fit together. The Duckett readings helped me grasp the CSS markup language and how boxes and layouts are created. The task that I set for myself was to be able to create a colorful box format to seperate my personal and professional Biography. The only thing that I was able to do successfully was change the color of my text, which when I looked up the style guide for purecss was the first and easiest thing to do. I am still playing around with the program. I would like to use the Bootstrap CSS program because it seemed like more systems use this. Although the PureCSS seemed simpiler, especially when you consider how minial the language is compared to Bootstrap. This is something that I would like to exlpore more in depth. Yet, my further investigation, I learned that purecss is more mobile friendly, which is not my greatest conern right now, but it is nice information to discover, especially as we further the construction of our personal websites.

While I enjoyed the Duckett readings and attempted tp merge CSS and HTML together, which was the biggest struggle that I faced. I felt like I did not understand the different markups, and when applying the CSS to my current HTML Bio file. I needed to do further exploration. While I did see where the color of my text would be inserted, I am still trying to understand the marks needed to insert my CSS box text, which I have already constucted, but have not been able to apply. I did an expect element search to see how it was applies to basic websites, but, as expected there were markings in this that I had trouble navigating as I am not yet familiar with the language.
