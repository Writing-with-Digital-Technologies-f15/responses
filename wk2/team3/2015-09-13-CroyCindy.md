## Summaries and Connections
In “The Science of Handwriting”, Brandon Keim discusses the importance of handwriting. He has noticed that many people prefer composing their thoughts with pen and paper rather than by typing on a keyboard (p. 2). In describing the importance of writing with pen and paper, he highlights the evidence that  using our hands to write activates different parts of our brain than writing with keystrokes. In fact, these areas of the brain are purely visual (p. 4), so actually forming characters on the page with a pen helps us recognize the letters . He also mentions that object manipulation parallels development of childrens' ability to speak, so having motor involvement with literacy, in the form of writing with our hands, helps with developing communication ability (p. 3).

Christina Haas tries to complicate the relationship between old and new technology in “On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies”.  She thinks the models of the relationship are too simplistic and uses three case studies to illustrate her point. In the first, she describes management of city utilities and infrastructure. In this environment, the city workers did not use much, if any, digital technology. Their interaction was in the form of written notes and oral communication during meetings and phone calls. The only use of digital technologies came during contract work with an engineering firm. This firm used computer assisted drawing software to make their plans for extending a water main. The comments by the city on the plans were in written form and were either faxed or hand delivered (pps 214-216). The second case study also involved this city. A new city manager came from another city which used electronic communication and sought to implement the same system in his new job. The city workers were not interested and believed their paper system worked just fine (pps 216-218). The third case study was in an abortion clinic. Here they used paper and pencil to identify patients and record their history. They also had a fancy brochure from the government that detailed normal fetal development. Haas describes the difference between the uses of these two documents. Essentially the paper with patient information was essential while the brochure was ignored (pps 218-221). From here she discusses these case studies in relation to Bijker's theory of technological change. Bijker believes that technological change is not linear, that some aspects of technology have to be constant while others change, that use of technology may be costrained by external forces, and that there may be different interpretations technology's use. 

In “<table>ing the Grid”, Bradley Dilger describes grid systems in the development of web sites. He discusses how grids became part of the international typgraphic style. This style advocated standardization in design, content, and function, and grid systems provide an excellent way of doing this (p. 219). Another advantage of grid use is that grids expand and contract as users change font and screen size (p.). For these reasons Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) based their templates on tables. These templates allow an effective and efficient approach to design because designers could specify where exactly on the page these items would go. The templates could also be used to make all pages within a site have the same look and feel (p. 220).

“The Future of Layout with CSS: Grid Layouts” is a web site that shows how to use grid layouts in CSS. It provides definitions for grid, lines, tracks, cells, and areas. It also stresses that one advantage of CSS grids is to separate layout and markup, although how to do this was not clear to me. (https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/css-grid-layout-6c9cba6e8a5a)

Connections and Commentary

The connections between these articles are best viewed in the context of the relationship between old and new technology. This is the focus of Christine article. The other articles fall into either “old” (The Science of Handwriting) or “new” (<table> ing the Grid and The Future of Layout with CSS: Grid Layouts). Dilger's article discusses the development of <table> and the advantages of using <table> and grid systems while the Grid Layouts proceeds to instruct how to use the technology. Both of these articles highlight how grids allow scaling of web pages for different screen sizes, and the Grid Layouts article demonstrates how this works. Both the handwriting article and Haas's article mention the tension between old and new technology. Some people are slow to adopt new technology, and others predict various negative consequences from adopting new technologies. 

Some of my personal reactions to the articles:

I found the handwriting article particularly interesting because I'm one of those people who prefers to do at least some of my thinking on paper. It might be an interesting study to see if the fact that only one hand is intensely engaged in handwriting as opposed to both being required for keyboarding has an influence on this.

One of the statements that I didn't really agree with was that “A” and “a” are the same character, and we learn this through practice. They are not really the same character. A capital “A” means something – start of a sentence, part of an acronym, important word in a title – that a lowercase “a” does not. Of course we learn these things through practice too. Perhaps a more relevant comparison that would support the article better is that an “a” in Times vs. an “a” in Helvetica are the same character. 

The Grid Layouts article is difficult to follow for someone with no html experience.
