## Summaries

In Brandon Keim's article "The Science of Handwriting," he begins by suggesting that writing by hand and typing, while both completing the same task, engage the brain differently (55). He explains that there is little research on this subject, but what research there is does seem to suggest a connection between the hands and the mind (55). For example, a study in which adult participants were taught a new alphabet, one group by writing it and one group by typing it, showed that the participants in the hand-written group retained a better memory of the new alphabet after a few weeks (57). Another study of children learning to write revealed a link between an ability to write the alphabet by hand and the quality of the child's spelling and composition skills (58). Overall, writing by hand has a larger effect on various portions of the brain than typing does. This theory is not fact, but has been backed by several studies. 

I really liked the quote, > "In some circumstances, the text-manipulating powers of word-processing programs also offer a sheer speed that, for some people, ultimately feels more true to mind than handwriting...and just as Stephen Peverly...can offer anecdotes about students swapping laptops for notebooks because they better remember handwritten notes, some studies suggest the opposite (58)." I think there are benefits to both handwriting and typing, and I agree with Kiem that handwriting does affect the brain more strongly. It makes sense because handwriting is the natural way of writing while typing is a recent invention. I am very interested to find out, as Keim brought up, whether children raised typing will respond mentally to typing in the way that older generations respond mentally to writing by hand (55). Personally, I prefer typing for longer things like papers, as it feels more neat and clean. But for short notes I prefer writing by hand, maybe because it helps me remember the information better. 

Patrick Brosset's "The Future of Layout with CSS: Grid Layout" discusses the history and the various uses of the CSS Grid Layout. According to the article, in the past CSS has not been very practical for developing complex layouts, but now there is a new grid tool associated with CSS that can help a lot. Brosset explains the components of the grid and the markup that leads to a functioning grid website. He also gives an example of a site whose grid changes size based on the size of the screen that it is being viewed on. 

I don't have any experience with html and CSS, so this was a confusing article to me. He did a good job of selling the idea that the grid is very useful for website creation. However, I think you can only make so many sites like dribbble before the grid look gets a little old. I would have liked to see some examples of sites that used the CSS grid layout in a different way if possible. 

The Haas article, "On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies," discusses the idea that, at least at the time the article was written, technology was otfen viewed in too simplistic a light, particularly by those who were unfamiliar with it. Specifically, she references the "simple replacement model" and the "straightforward progress model," which both tie into the oversimplification concept and posit that technology moves forward with time, changing irrevocably and always brining about newer, better creations (210). Haas states that neither of these viewpoints is correct. Instead, she believes that there are connections between old and new technology and that they vary in effectiveness. She gives three examples of workplace scenarios where various forms of technology are involved. The first is an engineer whose job contains many different steps that will eventually lead to a successful project (214-16). Haas discusses how literacy of the technologies used in a work environment and communication regarding these technologies are very important. The simple replacement model does not make sense in this scenario because of all the detailed steps that everyone is familiar with and understands (216). The second example is about a city manager who wants to implement new technology in a town, but others who work with him oppose his ideas because they see no benefit in the new technology (going against the straightforward progress model) or they understand that the town is not currently in a position to accept the new technology (216-18). The third example is of an abortion clinic where a patient info form (an "old technology") is basically the backbone of how the clinic is run, whereas a shiny new brochure (a "new technology") gets buried in other paperwork and is not put to the use it was intended for (218-21). The straightforward progress model is not supported because in this case the old technology is much more valuable to the clinic than the new technology (221). 

While this article is a little older, I think the ideas in it still hold true. People are always frantically trying to keep up with the newest iphone or ipad or model of car and so on, but Haas points out that old and new technologies are both useful and often can work together to benefit a group of people. It requires awareness to understand where one's idea of technology might be overly simplified. Haas gives several solid, real-world examples of where an oversimplified view of technology is a misunderstanding of how the technology is used. 

"Tabling the Grid" by Bradley Dilger chronicles the development of the table layout that came out of a need for order after the internet began to get more popular. It was helpful for giving designers a standardized, customizable layout tool to control where items would appear on a webpage (216). Table was later overtaken by the popular CSS grid, which was similary standardized and structured. The current format of the grid does not allow for much creative innovation when it comes to building layouts(223). Dilger argues that a new form of the grid is needed that would combine the positive elements of both table and the grid and would also introduce new areas of flexibility for the designer (224-25). He offers many different quotes and references other books that back up his ideas--both the benefit of table and the danger that it can cause designers to keep themselves in an uncreative box. 

This article was interesting, as it offers a lot of insight into the birth of the internet and website design that I had never been aware of. It doesn't go into a lot of detail about the specific functions of the grid or table, opting instead for a more sweeping view of their history, uses, and drawbacks. I see so much variety in the way that websites look and behave that I am interested to see an example of one that "breaks" the grid somehow. I'm concerned that going against the long-held standards of CSS and html could destroy the usability factor that Dilger describes Jakob Nielsen as being such a huge proponent of (218). There could be a whole new learning curve after the implementation of a new grid. 

## Connections 

I saw a lot of connections between the Dilger and Brosset articles. They both discuss the uses of the CSS grid and how it has developed. Apparently, even though the grid was really nice for helping designers out when website creation was just beginning, there are still hiccups in it that make it not so useful for complicated design. Is the new CSS grid that Brosset talks about similar to the Grid 2.0 that Dilger describes? How does the new grid build on the old one? I didn't see a lot of variety in the examples Brosset gave of what the new grid can do: maybe it is only good for creating stronger designer control over the look of a site. In which case is it doing the oppposite of what Dilger wanted? He was arguing for a less-controlled website-building format. 

I also think that there are connections between the Dilger and Haas articles. Dilger does not regard technology in an overly simplified way. He sees that there are positive aspects to table and the grid, even though by this time they are "old technologies." He expresses the belief that combining old technology with a new Grid 2.0 could be the best and most freeing thing for website design. Whether this is an accurate view is unknown, but he does not accept the simple replacement model or the straightforward progress model that would suggest eliminating the older technologies for something new and therefore "better" to take their place. 

Finally, there are similar connections between the Haas and Keim articles. Keim's old and new technologies are handwriting and typing respectively. Keim accepts that typing may be as useful to a new generation as handwriting has been to an older one, but he also believes that handwriting is more connected to brain activity. While this is a good argument for retaining a combination of handwriting and typing, it is also almost an inversion of Haas's simple replacement and straightforward progress models. In this case, Keim suggests that handwriting is better than typing for various reasons, a perhaps overly-simplified view of the subject. Haas gives many examples where old technologies are completely efficient for the task they are meant to do, but today typing does offer a faster, easier to read, more standardized, easier to replicate, and easier to send anywhere in the world method of writing. Keim's arguments might by strengthened by taking Haas's points into account and building a more complex analysis of the benefits of handwriting vs typing.
