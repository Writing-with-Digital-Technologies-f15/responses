## Summaries
Kelm, Brandon. _The Science of Handwriting._
As the population moves farther into the digital age, the value and role of handwriting is under examination. Brandon explores the value of this fundamental part on communication and archival. What makes it different from typing is not only a physical difference in the actions, but how the action is then processed by one's thoughts. It's concluded that the act of writing and learning how to writes creates a profound and deep connection between the hand and the mind, something that typing cannot replicate. However, it is also noted that typing has its own role and niche in people lives, notably that it has a much clearer presentation over handwriting. There's also a working relationship between the two mechanics, hence why people will use both to some extent but under different contexts.

Haas, Christina. _On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies._
In this essay, Haas argues against the more dominant opinion in academia that dismisses further attention to technology's role in literary matters. Rather than the common, over-generalized concept that newer technology replaces older and obsolete technology, the point of this essay is to prove a more complicated relation between technololgies new and old, specifically literacy technologies. This is accomplished by using the studies of historian Wiebe Bijker to interpret findings from three case studies that explore the usage of literacy technologies in contemporary workplaces. What is concluded from this combination of theory and research is that there is a complex relationship between technologies of varied ages, that which lead to systems where they can coexist rather prominently in the workplaces examined. This provides evidence for the connetion to be further explored, rather than ignored by the institutes

Dilger, Bradley. _Tableing the Grid._
As this format of writing proves, markup is a valuable tool in web writing. Dilger's essay goes into the history of the markup type "table", from its development in the 1990's to its eventual decline. Along the way, there's an exploration on the great impact that table markup had in website design and the philosophies of webwriters over the period of its usage to today. As a tool, tables set up a gridlike layout that was immensely useful in the creation of "regulated" and predictable websites. This led to the concept of a "style" to follow, much like how publications have a style guide when creating websites, focusing on organization and grids. With the introduction of CSS, markup began to decline in it prominence due to CSS's higher efficiency. In time, tables became obsolete in modern website design.

Brosset, Patrick. _The Future of Layout with CSS: Grid Layouts._
This article is a very instructional one, introducting a new specification, or feature of CSS. A tutorial is provided to explain how to create grid layouts, including an explanation of the components to make grids. The benefit of this specification is that it allows for the separation of layout and markup, which allow for easier alteration of one without affecting the other. According to Brosset, it's especially useful for designing mobile sites and handling the organization of media items like photos.

## Connections
Across these readings, I can see a theme of how the progression of technology is handled and discussed, which is mostly seen as positive or neutral. _The Science of Handwriting_ examines writing as a technology and how the newer technology of typing. _On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies_ argues about how technology should be more seriously considered by the academic community. _Tableing the Grid_ is an account of table markup, taking note into its influence on how people believe websites should be designed. Lastly, _The Future of Layout with CSS: Grid Layouts_ is an article that informs of a new change in CSS that can greatly enhance the creation and organization of modern websites. All of them involve this idea of time and how technological changes are influencing future movements and innovations

Brosset's article feels like a followup to Dilger's essay about tables. The concept of an organized, gridlike layout exists becaust of table markup, and now in the present, the concept grids are taken into account for designing more workable sites, leading to developments such as CSS Grid Layouts. Interestingly enough, while tables were popular for creating a more uniform style, the new concept or grids are now considered innovative for being flexible to work with.

While the examination of the hand's connection to thought in Kelm's essay may not be considered a literacy technology for the research done in Haas's study, handwriting could be seen as one. Both articles are interested in the connection between an old technology, such as handwritten letters and a clinic's "blue sheet", with the more recent technologies of typing and a full color pamphlet, with both the old and new being recognized for their value in their respective circumstances
