##Summaries
###The Science of Handwriting

Brandon Keim’s article, “The Science of Handwriting," discusses the effects handwriting (versus typing) has on how we think. Keim begins by discussing the evolutionary importance of hands, and how handwriting focuses in a way quite unlike typing (Keim 3). Keim next reviews research indicating that the visual and motor activity of handwriting might serve as an aid to memory and complex thought in ways typing does not. While noting the advantage of typing in terms of producing text quickly, Keim connects physical handwriting’s relationship to and existence within space to other mental architecture. 

At one point, Keim refers to handwriting as a “mentally recursive…feedback-looping interplay between thoughts and knowledge” (Keim 5). I think this is perhaps his most compelling claim—that handwriting becomes part of the thought process and both shapes and is shaped by the written word.

###On the relationship between old and new technologies
In "On the relationship between old and new technologies," Christina Haas hopes to replace a simple explanation of the relationship between old and new technologies with a more nuanced and thus more accurate take. Haas begins by discussing *mediational means* and *the historical-genetic method*, two concepts of Lev Vygotsky that Haas applies in her mission to complicate things. Mediational means depicts technology as intimately tied to cultural practices and structures. The historical-genetic method, meanwhile, encourages scholars to understand the historical context and relationships surrounding a technology in order to understand the technology today. 

After describing Vygotsky’s concepts and how they can complicate the relationship between new and old technologies, Haas describes three case studies that also complicate the new-old technology relationship. These studies, which took place in government offices and an abortion clinic, support three observations indicating the complexity of the relationship between new and old technology:

1) workplaces today harbor competing views of what technology is and can do

2) work is completed using more than one (both new and old) literacy technology

3) the most important literacy technology is not necessarily the newest or most advanced (Haas 213)

Finally, Haas discusses how four theoretical concepts of Bijker can further complicate the relationship between new and old technology. Bijker’s concept of *non-linearity* understands that new technology does not evolve in a single line, and instead results from a myriad of influences. Haas uses Bijker’s concepts of *contingency* and *constraint* to describe technology choices made based on the current circumstances and limits. Another concept, *interpretive flexibility*, allows a single piece of technology to be interpreted in multiple ways by multiple people. Technologies can also be used to exercise *power*, the final concept Haas applies to the relationship between new and old technologies.

I think this paper really highlights the importance of context when studying a topic. Both of Vygotsky and Bijker’s concepts refer in different ways to the idea of knowing the background and history of technology, whether it’s what influenced the development of a technology or how different people perceive it. These concepts could also act as overarching themes for this week’s other readings.

###tableing the grid

Bradley Dilger describes how the table function helped translate the international typographic style common in Switzerland to the web. This style, which emphasized objectivity and efficiency, was easy to apply with early, text-friendly HTML (Dilger 214).

Dilger goes on to describe how the creators of the visual design language CSS were influenced by table. Just like table, the design of CSS “boosted the ability of designers to create Web sites with layouts that focused on type” (Dilger 220). Page elements in CSS are rectangular and positioned along an xy axis, mimicking the grid of table. CSS also encouraged consistency, like the international style, by encouraging the creation of template style sheets.

Beyond simply improving the visual design of web pages, Dilger also connects table to improving the communication of messages and subsequent thought over the internet. The table, and eventually the grid-based CSS, was a way to standardize communication in a rational manner. Dilger also briefly mentions the ability to scale table contents based on table size, which translated well to monitors and browsers of different sizes. (Dilger 216) I thought this mention was particularly applicable to web design today, as the importance of responsive design that function on desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets is greater than ever. 

Dilger concludes by describing the drawbacks of a table-based, standardized web design based on the grid. Essentially, this standard can lead to uniformity and boredom when taken too far. Dilger calls for alternatives to grid-based layouts that embody the table values of objectivity and efficiency without always limiting design to a strict grid.

###The Future of Layout with CSS: Grid layouts

Patrick Brosset’s article on CSS Grid Layouts begins by discussing grid theory, or what a grid is and what it does. Essentially, grids are invisible lines that define where web content is placed. Grids give the site visual structure. Earlier version of CSS didn’t support grids without using complicated work-arounds, which has made creating complex and responsive site layouts difficult without a lot of work. No major web browsers completely support this feature yet, but Brosset indicates that it is only a matter of time. 

Brosset goes on to discuss the different parts of a grid (lines, tracks, cells, and areas), and how grids are different from our old friend, tables. While tables are created using HTML, grids are created almost entirely in CSS, which allows web developers to separate the content from the layout. This allows designers to work solely in CSS, if desired. CSS-based grids essentially allow easy changes in layout and visual designs, as well as good responsiveness to media-queries. Media-queries tell websites to arrange themselves differently on different media, so a website would look different on a phone than a tablet or a laptop. 

Brosset describes how to define grid areas and lines so that content can be easily attached to sections of the grid. He also mentions how the tricks developers have had to use in lieu of CSS grids in the past were the inspiration for this built-in solution and the creation of CSS Grid Layout.

This entire article has made me very curious about the tricks that developers currently use to make sites with complicated layouts, and the difficulties of using media-queries with today’s CSS. I have dabbled a bit in CMS like WordPress and Drupal, and done little more than poke around at themes and mobile responsiveness. I’d love to see an in-class example of layouts that could really benefit from CSS Grid Layout!

##Connections

I think the overarching theme of all four readings had to do with how our tools and technology shape what we create. The handwriting article clearly attributed the process of writing words by hand to a different product than words created with the same intent but typed instead. (I would also be interested in seeing a comparison of handwritten, typed, and spoken words in terms of the structure or shape of the final product.) Both the <table> and the grid layout readings reflected the reality of developers making new technology look like familiar technology—tables and grids allow web pages to look like "old technology" newspapers, with headers and footers and content columns.

Just as Haas discussed workplaces where new technology **supplements, but doesn't replace** old technology, I think the handwriting article makes a case for handwriting sticking around for special uses, like brainstorming or outlining papers, or taking notes in preparation for a class quiz.
