##On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies (Haas, 1999)
In this article, Haas primarily discusses the relationship between old and new technologies and how that relationship works out in the workplace. Before reading this article, I was unfamiliar with Vgotsky and Bijker’s theories, although I had heard both of their names come up in other courses. Two models that Haas was able to clearly refute from researching Vgotsky’s work was the simple replacement model and the straightforward progress model. The simple replacement model assumes that old and new technologies are completely different entities, while the straightforward progress model assumes that the latest product, or newest version of a preexisting product, is automatically better. Keeping these two models in mind while reading the article, my mind kept wandering to the impulse of the common American consumer. Ever since Apple took the personal device market by storm, it seems to me that a lot of people I am around would accept these models as fact. However, due to my prior experience and interest in Information Technology, I feel that people often assume the latest product is better simply because it costs more. This could be due to both the lack of technical literacy and the impulse that is created by the desire to own the “latest and greatest” device on the market. Application fanatics would be able to easily refute either of these models by pointing out bugs and unstableness within newer versions. Although the observations I made are on a simple level as well as in reference to modern technologies, Haas states that the relationship between old and new technologies is not simple and is often too over-simplified. She also points out that the term “technology” isn’t limited to computers; rather it encompasses elements such as John Jenkins’s penmanship mastery system that was designed to imitate moveable type. Thinking about this article in conjunction with this course, writing isn’t limited to putting a pen to paper or creating a document in Microsoft Word. Instead, modern writing has adapted to include nearly anything that consists of a phonetic, and sometimes symbolic, arrangement.

##<Table>ing the Grid (Dilger)
I read this article after Haas and one parallel that kept entering my head throughout was the historical-genetic method outlined by Haas. Although this method wasn’t explicitly mentioned in Dilger’s article, I felt that one point that he tried to drive into the reader implicitly was that <table> is a predecessor of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Before CSS, tables allowed for complete control of page design and layout. When designers have this sense of control, they are able to abide by standardized design, while simultaneously allowing for better control over their page’s content and functionality. From what I understood in this article, tables help to conform pages to international defaults by dividing said pages into grids. After a stable version of CSS was released, <table> became obsolete. However, without <table>, CSS would not exists, therefore making <table> the historical-genetic predecessor of CSS. One quote I would like to pull into discussion was from Curt Cloninger who said, “The goal is effective communication—clear and uncluttered” (p. 218).  From a web-design perspective, this directly relates to the <table> as being responsible for the (mostly) clear and uncluttered world wide web we are able to surf with ease today. If anyone in my group is familiar with HTML, maybe you can answer the following question for me: Dilger ends his article with, “In summary, we need a Grid 2.0 that, like Web 2.0, is simultaneously a rethinking of the grid and a return to values characterizing its technical heritage” (p.225); don’t we basically have his idea of a “Grid 2.0” through the updates that have occurred in CSS? I thought this was an abrupt ending to an otherwise interesting and informative article.

##The Science of Handwriting (Keim, 2013)
This article was my favorite of the three to the creative-nature of the topic. Once again, while reading this article, I connected the dots of handwriting being the historical-genetic predecessor of type. While this may seem obvious, it is important to note all the important benefits of handwriting that is outlined in the article, such as the communicative system of hand to eye to attention and how hands help us see (p. 8), the formation of lines and designs on paper versus aesthetically-synced text on screen, and how handwriting improves letter recognition. Children growing up in this generation may not understand the importance of the skills handwriting teaches your mind and body. When the 2010 curriculum adjustments were mentioned in the article, I began to think how the switch to a completely paperless society can actually be detrimental. On the individual level, I could see how elimination of handwriting could create a dependence on the device a given document is created on. But what happens if this device breaks? I am willing to bet that the individual who created the document on the device would be able to recall much less than if they had created it on paper, or even created n outline on paper. Another theory this article reminded me of was Marshall McLuhan’s “the medium is the message;” or how a given document is created versus the content of it. From a personal perspective, I still create my outlines on paper just as I was taught in my first college English course. I also find myself relating more to Haas, who mentioned that she uses handwriting for deep thinking. Whenever I write lyrics for music, I always create a draft on paper. I have found that this makes it easier not only for the vocalist, who may be reading it and be trying to find the melody and rhythm of the lyrics, but for myself as the writer to pencil in auxiliary lyrics, structures, and other elements of songwriting.
