**The Science of Handwriting**
This ariticle was fascinating to read, especially in a class that is very laptop dependent, it's almost ironic. In fifth grade I had a teacher with severe dyslexia, and she would ahve to write out her lesson plans in three different notbook, in order for it to be understandable. She would always explain to the class that writing things out, even multipl times, would be the best way to learn the material, and she always expressed the importance of note-taking, and then note re-writing if we wanted to really learn something. When the author mentions that the children were able to learn the alphabet better, after writing them doen, really makes sense, and drives home the what we were taught in elementary school. This alphabet learning is also true when you are learning the characters of a different language, like Kanji, for Chinese or Japanese. I too, have experience taking Japanese in high school, and can relate to the study, because visualizing the character is much easer after consistantly writing it down. Like Keim says, the connection between the action and your eyes, is everything. Letter recognition, is fundamental to reading and if writing increases this recognition than can being a better writer make you a better reader? or is it vice versa? These are questions I have. 

**Old and New Technology**
The article on old and new technology examines three workplace case studies about communicative technology. I was unfamiliar with Bijker's theory on Sociotechnical change, I had to search for a more succint definition, so that I could understand the breakdown of all parts of the theory that Haas presents. The most interesting part of the article was the contradiction of contigency and contstraint in the theory, which I believe can be applied to the intersection of society and tehcnology as a whole. The idea was the tehcnology is always changing, but this cannot be true, because if tehcnology is always changing then is would be unusable.I believe that the phrase "tehcnology is alwasy changing" is more applicable to generation X and baby boomers who moved existed within the time of the invention of these technologies, let alone their incorporation into the workplace and everyday life. Think of when your parents decide to buy an iPhone- they could learn the techonology so they are capable of using their phone, but unlike our generation, they're not going to understand the update to the interface of iTunes, nor will they care, and the will probably keep using their 4s even though it is two generations behind the update. Like in the case study of the City of Ashton, technological advancements can be constrained by the status quo, and the entrenched methods of communication could be updated, but implementing a new system, could prove to be impossible, or at least take much longer, than expected. 
The case studies in the article also made me think about the kinds of workplaces were these technology communications would fall short. The general theme is the idea of miscommunication and taking the workplace into a newer technological age, by using a newer way to give presentationns or streamlining communication through several branches of the company. However, now at least my experience, is that their needs to be a basic understanding of technology communication, as well as having the capbilities to learn, understand, and be able to employ in coming tehcnologies. The introduciton of these tehcnologies, especially, in the newer workplaces, may face less of a resistance, than the case studies that Haas pulled her analysis from. However, the example of the City of Ashton appears to me as the most relatable and understandable to understnading the collison of old and new technologies, because I imagine cities across America facing this struggle. Comparing the level of efficiency that new tehcnology provides, with American reluctance to change, the growing sociotehcnological implications will overcome the resistance to change. If society continues to be engaged by technology, which is appeal that is as important as the efficeny of technology, then the change will come. Haas points out the pathos in the theory of sociotechnology and that is the aspect of power. Having the most soguht after advancements, consists of being able to engage people as well as making the best use of thier time, weilds power in the workplace. 

**Table History**

Dilgers article on the grid, the exploration of web design brings in the element that I am more farmiliar with from my writing course classes, and that is typography. When he discuss the similiarties, usabliity, and uniqueness of web designs I felt that these finiding, accurately corresponded with the growing popularty of the internet in everyday life. The similiarity between websites, does in a way, attest to its usablity, because the value of graphics, and branding through a website is a more recent idea that is still developing. One of the greatest contributions of the web is international usability, and this can be in part in the grid design, as well as the translation vaiable or the familiarty of the context of the site, but regardless of this, you can log onto anything clothing website, in any language, in any country, and be able to navigate shopping for basics, just on the layout alone. I believe that the grid can be opened up, but that would need to happen in time, because the realitivty of teh internet is still catching on, and computer science and understanding is not a requrirement of basic education, this could be a political contingency in the development of an open grid web design. The grid is rhetorical, and the way that it is currently taught, deems it essential for web design. 

**CSS**
This was very useful. I really like the picutre and the example, because it hard reading about a grid and all the changes and specifications, without actually seeing a grid. I am hoping more time in this class will help me understand more about the terminology and idea presented in this article.
