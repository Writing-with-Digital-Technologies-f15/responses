Keim, Brandon. (Oct. 2013). The science of handwriting. Scientific American Mind, pp. 54-62. PDF copy..

"The science of handrwiting" by Brandon Keim discusses the differences in cognitive thought when a person is either writing by hand or typing. Throughout this article, Keim reveals that the difference in cognitive thought between typing and writing is the ability to think spatially and to ability to retain information. In order to prove his case, Keim cites UofM professor Christina Haas and University of Stavanger Anna Manga,  professors who did case studys on foreign language retention through handwriting and the increased spatial focus that comes writing by hand. Christina Haas, in a small case study found that "students seemed to do a better job of planning their writing by hand than by keyboard." Likewise, Ann Manga is quoted in saying that, "[handwriting] unifies hand, eye and attention at a single point in space and time".  This is drastically different to a keyboard, which is inherently split apart into multiple functions. Keim anecdotally concludes with his own story of writing the article, saying "I can report, in this nonconclusive, N of 1 study, with no controls or standardized metrics or objective behavioral outcomes, that writing by hand felt a good, even right."

I agree wholeheartedly with Keim's analysis of the science of handwriting. While, I previously never considered the importance of spatial dimensions when writing by hand, I always had the impression that "writing by hand felt good, even right"(Keim). So, I thought that Anna Mangen brings up a good point by stating that hand writing unifies hand, eye and attention. It enables me to focus my attention as opposed to blindly typing or copying from one screen to another. Ultimately, it feels good, watching your thoughts turning into words and then being scribed down, all at the same time. Handwriting requires that incremental increase in effort which, I believe, drives an in crease in cognitive thought. 

Haas, Christina. (1999). On the relationship between old and new technologies. Computers & Composition, 16, pp. 209-228. PDF copy.
 
Christina Haas, "On the relationship between old and new techonlogies" sheds light on the lack of information and serious scholarship done on the progression of technology and the oversimplification of it's inherent qualities.  She uses numerous methodologies to drive the point across that certain misconceptions about technology are rampant in today's corporate enviroment and these misconceptions are overly simplified viewpoints of techonlogy. In order to rectify the problem, Haas describes how technology isn't understood properly. She procedes to cite how the typewriter was considered new technology thirty years ago, yet appears to today's culture as something that always existed. She refutes the concept that new technologies are inherently better. She gives a purview of the multiple levels of technological literacy inherent in an enviroment and the various skills and tasks required for each use of technology.

I  enjoyed Haas' analysis on the misconception that new technology is always better than the alternative. Haas takes a case study done in an Abortion Clinic and analyses what the staff at the Hospital do with a blue sheet of paper. As a patient enters the clinic, he or she is immediately assigned a typewritten sheet of blue paper. On this paper, doctors and nurses will write important diagnostic information, insurance information and other various pieces of information. In contrast,a federally mandated pamphlet is handed out to every patient. This pamphlet according to Haas, "is by far the most advanced mediating artifact in use at the clinic"(220). However, the pamphlet, due to Hospital Staff interaction and Patient reaction, ahas an incredibelly low reception and retention rate. Such a low rate that one of the assitancts belieed that less than one in five patients took the pamphlets home. It draws a sharp contrast between the necessary importance of archaic text document and the relatively high technological production value of graphically designed products. It really makes clear how old technology can still have huge relevance to important decisions while new technologies are ignored or even marginalized. 



Dilger, Bradley. (2010). <table>ing the grid: In B. Dilger & J. Rice (Eds.), From a to <a>: Keywords of markup, (pp. 213-227). Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press. PDF copy..

Dilger Bradley's opinion article, <table>ing the grid tries to drive the notion that a deacentralized process of creating web pages is needed in Web 2.0. Bradley strengthens his argument by focusing on the topic of Web 1.0. He discusses the creation and utilization of <tables> as a medium of web design and the resulting creative ethos that occured from it. <Tables>, a grid based browser modification system became more and more prominent in the 2000 era of website design and it drove a cultural current of web designers focused on text heavy, aesthetically appealing websites. With the introduction of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the use of <tables> as a website editing element became more emphasized. Graphical display on websites were all determined by grid like assignment. However, because of this, "Designers were comfortable not breaking the grid"(223). As a result of all this, current website development hinges heavily on CSS and
HTML scripts which are  grid derived. 

I find this article interesting because it gives an in-depth analysis on design ethos. Once a style, <table> was found that which pleased a majority of designers, it instantly became the preferred method of operations for the rest of website development to follow behind. If things had happened any differently, websites designed could be in a manner that is almost unrecognizable to how we approach things currently. Once you get a ball rolling, it becomes extremely hard to stop.

Brosset, Patrick's "The future of layout wth CSS: Grid layouts", tutorial goes over the introduction of complex layout formats in CSS. He goes over the 'dribble' command, a new function that enables tables to fill out extra table space as specified by the computer. Essentially, as opposed to forcing a single table, for instance, [item 1] to be filled with specific text, the dribble function enables text to fill out the rest of the items, eg, [item 1 - item 5] as it sees fit. It's interesting to note that this script enables a browser to dynamically adjust text, even when it's being resized. This is a huge change in previous <table> formats. 
	This is an extremely interesting advancment in Grid layout technology because it gives web designers functionality that isn't bound by a single table variable. While I have never designed a website using HTML and CSS, I  appreciate dynamic resizing when I browse the internet. This is also indicative of progress in CSS, something that I didn't realize was continuing on. 
    
## Connections

Christina Haas' article, "On the relationship between old and new technologies" and Brandon Keim's article, "The science of handwriting" share interesting themes. Christina Haas, in her article puts forth numerous methodologies by which she analyzes the oversimplification of technological concept. One point in particular that she refutes is the concept that newer technologies are better than older technologies. She refutes this concept by addressing how the technology is implemented. Keim further emphasizes this point by discussing the difference between typing and writing. As opposed to driving the point that they're similar, Keim emphasizes the differences between the two. While it could be argued that typing is more efficient, Keim eventually concludes that writing by hand simply, "feels good". According to Keim, Writing by hand focuses the writer to concentrate all mind, hand and eyes on a single object and increases retention of what was written. Both of these articles refute a cultural concept that is prevalent through a modern society obsessed with find and buying the newest gadget. 


Bradley Dilgers article, "<table>ing the grid> and Patrick Brosset's webpage on, "The future of layout with CSS:Grid layouts" share a focus on the grid layout of web pages. However, while Dilger's article is focused on the formation of <table> and the eventual creation of grid layouts, Brosset expands further on about the design elements of the grid format through CSS. Both authors are focused on refining web design techonlogy. Dilger believes it's through the decentralization of the grid format, and it seems that Brosset is following up on this five years on from when it was published. Web design is becoming more dynamic and adaptive. This is something Bradley desired and Brosset implemented.
