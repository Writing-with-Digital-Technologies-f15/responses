Keim, Brandon. (Oct. 2013). The science of handwriting. Scientific American Mind, pp. 54-62. 

	In this article, Keim discusses the value of handwriting in face of the keyboard and other methods of writing we currently have available to us. He argues that writing by hand engages the brain in a different, perhaps more meaningful manner than typing, and may be a necessary part of development; evidence of increased activity in certain areas of the brain, and better understanding and retention of information, comprise some of Keim's argument for this. While the author offered some compelling evidence for his argument, it also seems clear that they are qualifiers to add some weight to the authors intended discussion of his feelings and speculation on the subject. The preliminary studies and observations presented in the article do not present satisfactory answers to Keim's questions, but do provide paths for the reader's own thoughts. 

Haas, Christina. (1999). On the relationship between old and new technologies. Computers & 	Composition, 16, pp. 209-228 

	In this article, Haas seeks to take the simplistic, linear view of the evolution of literacy technology and reveal it's complex, branching and intertwining nature. She touches on many ideas throughout the course of this paper. One, technology evolves from multiple iterations, while history picks one iteration as the key player and creates an evolutionary line. Two, older technology may eventually be viewed as non-technology, and people tend to separate “hand, books, print” from computers. Three, the age of a certain type of technology does not necessarily relate to its power in practical use. One example Haas uses is of simple paper slips that hold an immense amount of power when keeping track patient records, compared to modern government-issued pamphlets that have little power because they are utilized in a way that diminishes their presence. I felt this was a great illustration of how intent and organization infuse a particular technology with power, rather than the technology itself providing power to accomplish tasks. Four, different types of technology have different societal/cultural roles. As she explains in her contractor example, people expected to use different methods of communication (notes, emails, drawings) ion different situations because it simply made sense to them to do so. The reinforces that new technology doesn't simply replace old versions, but may fill a different niche. Additionally, while different technologies may fill different roles, people must be willing to use them; if someone has an efficient system running with an old technology, they may see no use in a new one. Hence, the new technology can only create a problem where there was none.

Dilger, Bradley. (2010). <table>ing the grid: In B. Dilger & J. Rice (Eds.), From a to <a>: Keywords 	of markup, (pp. 213-227). Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press. 

	This article discusses the history and use of grid design, how it is intrinsic to web development in its standardized form of the table HTML tag, and an essential tool both in terms of aesthetics and functionality. While it provides uniformity, organization, and accessibility, it can also be a “dull” and “rigid” system. The author goes on to argue that “web design needs to open up the grids of <table>,” allowing for rethinking which keeps to the core characteristics that make the grid such a useful design, while also allowing innovation in area that is comfortable, but has stagnated. I found that the author provided great background knowledge for the subject, and made a strong case explaining how design has stagnated and why the standards should loosened.\

Brosset, Patrick. (26 Aug. 2015). The future of layout with CSS: Grid layouts. Medium.com. Retrieved 	03 Sep. 2015 

	This article provides a explanation of what the CSS grid layout is, how it works, explains its key advantage, and shows the reader what it can look like in practice. The intent is to provide a primer for the CSS grid layout, and encourage the reader to learn more about, and utilize this layout. This was interesting to read, as it helped explain why this design can be so beneficial in a simple way, and gave a clear introduction while also indicating the depth that is possible with this system.
