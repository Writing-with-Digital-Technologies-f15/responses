## Summary

1) In “On the Relationship between Old and New Technologies”, Haas seems to be arguing that the old model of understanding technology’s history is very out of date. That technological progress is not linear, as so much of the field of writing seems to think, but rather it is all a product of the humans who use them and the times in which they are trying to communicate.  Through three abbreviated case studies, Dr. Haas examines in what ways such competitions between old and new technologies are at play in the work place.  She finds them on both a personal level (where the coexist peacefully) and at a less-peaceful interpersonal level.  What she further goes on to describe is Wiebe Bijker’s explanation of the forces at work on technology which cause its change: That some technologies can actually be seen as different things by different groups, and power’s role on technology both on a macro (semiotic) and micropolitical level.

2)  “table ing the Grid” reviewed the history of the styles of web site layout and what movements and people they were influenced by.  The <table> program had a huge impact on informing design standards, specifically in the United States, largely because of its relationship to (and success of) the international style.  CSS, a popular style of website layout today, also take a lot from the international style and table.  The author argues that the most effective variations of such types of design, as visually and applicably efficient as they can be, are those which every so often break out of the rigid table-like structure.

3) In “The Science of Handwriting”, Brandon Keim undertakes writing this article about handwriting longhand, and in so doing, comes to conclusions about its effectiveness through his firsthand experience.  Citing several studies, he makes the arguments that developing children, and those learning a new language, tend to retain more when they are handwriting the letters.  These same children (and subsequently adults) grow up to be more literary because of the good footing they gained with writing when they were young.  Writing cannot be separated from the physical processes that create it, and our hands become an integral part of the process as our brain is forming connections about letters.  We also have a spatial dimension to writing, and he argues that our brains can more easily process things like flowing notes on a page, when we can picture where they are on that page.

4) The Future of Layouts with CSS: Grid Layouts.  Brosset breaks down what it is that makes CSS such a functionally useful web design by going back to the basics of grids in general.  We then learn the coding which can allow us to design our own grids and he shows that they can be further manipulated to shrink or stretch depending on the size of the browser they are being viewed on.

## Connections

1)What these two articles are making me wonder, is what is it that inherently makes us think of all words as the same thing.  It might be easier to understand why our different types of communication create have different effectiveness in certain situations and why they connect different neurons in our brains, if we think of them as different activities.  Is it the difference b/w driving and biking?  Is it the difference b/w eating a salad and eating a steak?  Maybe – considering when we do communicate in different ways, it’s to communicate different things, maybe we should be focusing on what those different situations are for and not so much that we’re using a different means within them.

2)What I gather specifically from Haas’s article is that there is this impression of the literacy field as seeing certain technologies being out to completely replace the previous ones.  But to me it feels like the rise of certain technologies, by enabling us to communicate in different ways, has created separate “tracks” of progress in our society, which didn’t exist before.  One uses a Twitter or a Facebook account to communicate instantly with an enormous number or people now, which is a situation that 20 years ago just couldn’t be done in the same way.  You don’t always need to do that, however, so phone calls still work pretty good for talking to one person.  So too, is there a difference in creating such a document, which may later be delivered to the public, and writing notes for yourself when you want to remember an important interaction.  Technology in all areas of progress has never been a linear thing, whether that line moves up or down or slower or faster.  It’s a tree which constantly is branching out.
