## Summary

_The Science of Handwriting_ by Brandon Kiem

Brandon Kiem's article focuses on how handwriting plays a larger role in how the brain develops. He uses studies which tested how handwriting affects and contributes to development. One example included easier, longterm recognition of letters compared to typing letters. Another showed that handwriting letters not only prompted motor activity, but also elicited visual imagery (4). Learning to handwrite also contributed to organizing and storing information (5). Kiem concludes that although there have been limited studies done on handwriting and the mind, that handwriting is still a considerable important aspect of early learning. 

_<table>ING THE GRID_ by Bradley Dilger

In <table>ING THE GRID, Bradley Dilger provides an in-depth history into how web designing has changed from when the Web was first created. The international style was known for its simplistic and specific approach to designing. CSS, on the otherhand, allowed designers to have more control over how to format font type, something that HTML did not allow for (220). CSS also allowed designers easier control over formatting a website, which steered Web designing closer to using grids (220). 

_On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies_ by Christina Haas

In this reading, Christina Haas argues that the relationship between old and new technologies should be complicated. She also argues that this relationship has become too simplified, using examples such as the simple replacement model and the straightforward progress model as not sufficient enough in explaining how old and new technology are related (221). Haas uses Vygotskian's concepts to analyze how old and new technology actually work in tandem based on its origin and culture (212). She also uses Bijker's theory of sociotechnical change to analyze observations made from her case studies. Technology is nonlinear, changing but yet constant, and it can be interpreted differently based on its historical context (223). 

_The future of layout with CSS: Grid Layouts_ by Patrick Brosset

Patrick Brosset's article on grid layouts provides an in-depth look at what grids are, its terminology, and how to use it. Brosset shows the viewer how to create grids with CSS and how to format it to reflect changes. 


## Connections

One connection I drew was from  Brosset and Dilger's articles. Brosset explained some of CSS grid layouts basic functions while Dilger provided a history. Both also discuss how grids are useful ways of designing. 

Another connection I noticed was from Haas and Kiem's articles. I thought it was interesting how both reflected on old and new technologies. Handwriting could be considered an old technology, whereas word processors are a new technology. From Kiem's article, one is not necessarily better than the other. Both could be equally useful.
