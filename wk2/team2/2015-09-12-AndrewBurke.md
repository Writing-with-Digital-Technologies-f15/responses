## Summaries:
Summary of The Science of Handwriting: Hands play an important role in our evolution as humans. This is especially true in the evolution of our communication. The development of hands allows for gesture and writing, two influential steps in communication. As society shifts away from old-fashioned pencil-and-paper writing in favor of typing on a keyboard, studies and inquiries about the written word and the link between hands and the mind are demonstrating how handwriting is still an important mental process that should not be phased out so easily.

Summary of On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies: Christina Haas speaks out against prevailing opinions in academics that suggest the relationship between old and new in technology is simple, linear and separate. New does not simply replace old, and newer technology is not better than older technology by virtue of it being new. Her argument draws from the work of Lev Vygotsky to show that technology doesn’t simply evolve to be better over time, but is rather a reflection of larger human practices at that time.

Summary of tabl>ing the Grid: This article chronicles the methods designers have employed to build Web sites, from the Internet’s original surge in popularity in the 90’s to today. It discusses how table in HTML+ enabled designers to have sense of order and control over their pages, how CSS took over for table on most sites, and how the desire for a standard page design through <table> shaped the development of the Internet as a system.

Summary of The future of layout with CSS: Grid Layouts: The author discusses CSS: Grid Layouts, a new set of properties within CSS that allows a Web page designer to shape and use grids to align the content on their page. He shows what a grid is and how it pertains to page design, and then demonstrates exactly what Grid Layouts will make possible for content placement in CSS, showing the code templates and illustrations in the process.

##Connections:
The Science of Handwriting and On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies share a connection. Old and New Technologies is all about how new isn’t necessarily better than old and how the two build off of one another, and The Science of Handwriting shows exactly that. Even in the face of the new technology of typing, the old technology of handwriting is still worthwhile. Handwriting gives us a personal connection with what we write that is not so present in typing. We relate to and remember our ideas more strongly with handwriting, and can shape them more flexibly.

tableing the Grid and The future of layout with CSS: Grid Layouts both deal in Web page design and grids as well as how these systems shape and define how we view the Internet. This relates both to how we literally see content on the page and how we understand the Internet as a system, whether it should be orderly and standardized or limitless and free.

tableing the Grid offers a counterpoint to the main argument of On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies; the newer technology of CSS did eventually replace table in the design of most Web pages, though the two did coexist for a while with neither one being truly standard.
