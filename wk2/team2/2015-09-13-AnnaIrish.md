## Summaries:
_The Science of Handwriting_ by Brandom Keim:

Keim evokes the question of whether or not the medium of writing affects the quality of the work, specifically looking at writing by hand versus typing online. There are distinctions between typing and writing such as the correlation between writing by hand and spatial properties, the physicality of writing, and the uniqueness of letters formed by hand. The importance of learning to write by hand at a young age is starting to come into question with today's rapid technology growth. Keim concludes that the research on this subject is not conclusive but it is significant enough to continue researching.

_On The Relationship Between Old and New Technologies_ by Christina Haas:

Haas describes that oversimplifying technology neglets a deeper understanding of it and dismisses comlpex ideas that can be used to compare old and new technologies. Hass draws from Lev Vygotsky's concepts of literacy technologies to make a point that different technology is linked with the culture and history of its time. Therefore, no technology is necessarily better than another and literacy technology is not getting better or worse.

_tableing the grid_ by Bradley Dilger:

In _tableing the grid_, Dilger mentions a brief history of the unstandardized, chaotic Internet before <table> came out. <table> markdown influenced early design styles and international styles, allowing for pages to be sized according to their contents. Thanks to table, the grid became the popular layout on many websites including Facebook, CNN, Wikipedia, etc. As the Web advanced, CSS became a language for visual design, straying away from HTML, but still resonating with table's grid-based deisigns.  

_The future of layout with CSS: Grid Layouts_ by Patrick Brosset:

Brosset goes in depth of describing grid theory, specifically related to using CSS. The article defines different terms associated with grids such as cells, tracks, and lines then goes more in depth about different grid layouts for an actual webpage. He provides codes and visuals to go along with his description of the different possibilities of CSS layouts. 

### Connections:
Keim and Haas discuss the possible inequities of the educational system in regards to literacy technology. Keim is in favor of preserving learning to write by hand in schools, whereas Haas is unbiased in a particular technology and advocates for a deeper understanding of literacy technology. 

There was a strong connection between _tableing the grid_ and _The future of layout with CSS: Grid Layouts_. They both describe the usefulness of grid layouts. Brosset just dives more into the specifications of creating grid layouts, whereas Dilger goes into the history behind them and their visual importance.
