## Summaries
Duckett’s chapter “Structure” outlines the basic format for a site created out of HTML. He describes some of the different elements and how they work together to form things like headers and body sections. Attributes are an additional way of customizing a web page. 

I like how straightforward Duckett’s examples are. He simplifies website-building right down to the very basics. I’ve used tiny bits of html before, like in signatures on forum sites, so it was fun to discover that I already knew what an element was for, that is is repeated at the end of the line of information, etc. I also thought it was interesting how this reading tied in with some of our discussion last week--namely, that websites often attempt to imitate physical documents in the way they are formatted. The titles, headings, and body content of a web page is familiar to viewers who have had experience with books and other types of on-paper writing. 

“Links” is another chapter from Duckett, and in it he explains two different types of links that can be written in html. Both types use the element a and the attribute href. The first type is a link to an outside website, which requires the URL of the page you want to link to. The second is a link to a page within the same website. In this case you can use a folder name instead of a URL, with some specific guidelines depending on where the linked folder is in relation to the page you are starting at. Another helpful thing Duckett explains is how to code links to the top, bottom, and specific points on a long page of text. To do this, you must use the id attribute to name the points on the page that you want to link to. The id goes along with the h1/h2 elements. 

I think it is interesting to understand the code behind website functions that I use every day, like heading to a specific bullet point on a page by way of an id link. Href is also a good example of an attribute; seeing it used towards a link made the concept of an attribute easier to understand. 

“How Did We Get Here” by Pilgrim chronicles the long and complex process that has gotten us from html’s infancy in 1993 to the html5 of today. He starts out with an email exchange from designers in 1993 who were trying to figure out a way of inserting images onto a web page using code. Pilgrim goes through each of the suggestions that are offered and explains how they have or have not been put into effect. He then goes on to talk about MIME types and how these work in the html world. From what I gathered, they are the information that determines how the browser will read the code for a web page--like an html MIME doesn’t read small coding errors, or at least doesn’t react to them, but xhtml MIME does. To conclude, Pilgrim discusses the WHAT Working Group and how it developed html functions independently from W3C, which was working on establishing xhtml 1, 1.1, and 2. While there were benefits to xhtml, eventually W3C saw that the goals of WHAT Working Group were more realistic and beneficial to the public, so the two forces combined to create what we use now, html5.  

Pilgrim’s article was a little confusing because of all the technical terms that he uses, but he is very knowledgeable on the subject and made the history of html relevant and engaging. 

Hansa’s video describes the steps that the browser takes to get from html or css to a visual web page. The path html takes is: html, dom, render tree, layout, and paint. The render tree picks out the pieces of information that will be translated into visuals. He goes through several examples of what this process looks like and explains how it works. I found it a little confusing when he got to talking about the square drawing, and it seems like a lot of coding goes into every little bit of a web page. 

## Connections
I think it was interesting to learn about some of the basic aspects of html that are used today from Duckett, and then to learn about where they came from and the journey so many coders have taken to get html to the point that it is at from Pilgrim. It was also interesting to see in Pilgrim’s article that, though html and coding are complicated and seem very difficult to someone outside the field, the end goal of browsers and working groups is accessibility and usability for the public. This can be seen in the requirements for html evolutions and enhancements at the Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents. Duckett and Hansa’s goals are similar in that they want to present complex material on building and understanding website design in a way that is easy to understand. Duckett does this by breaking down the information into small sections and using lots of images and examples. Hansa does this by similarly using diagrams, examples, and familiar terminology like “tree” and “painting” in his descriptions. These pieces of writing and video build on one another to form a complete idea of html and web page creation for us, the readers/viewers/students. For example, Pilgrim talks about MIME while Duckett describes the steps of title, header, and paragraph that follow, and Hansa discusses the computer process that builds the visuals. Put all these steps together and it creates a full, functioning web page.
