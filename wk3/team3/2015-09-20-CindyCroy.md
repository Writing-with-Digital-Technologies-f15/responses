Duckett Chapter 1

In this chapter Ducket describes the basic structure of a web page. Elements are the individual units that make up a web page and define its structure. A word or letter bracketed by “<” and “>” (without quotes) starts the element, and the same word or letter bracketed by “</” and “>” (again without quotes) ends it. The word or letter with the brackets is called a tag, and each tag can also have attributes which provide additional characterization of the information in the element. The syntax for an element is <tag attribute name=”attribute value”>text</tag>.

Duckett Chapter 4

Chapter four explains how to add links to a web page. There are five types of link described: 1) a  link to another website; 2) a link to another page in the same website; 3) a link to a different part of the same page; 4) a link that opens an email application; and 5) a link that opens in a new window.  A syntax that combines terms from the first and the third type of link will allow linking to a specific part of a different page.  An “<a>” tag indicates a link, the href attribute specifies the page where the link leads, and the text before the ending “</a>” tag indicates the words the user clicks.

“How Did We Get Here” 

In this article Pilgrim explores the development of standards. He begins with the question “Why do we have an <img> element? (p3) He then follows the history of its development and concludes that the one (i.e. the code) that ships wins (p13).

One interesting point that he mentions is that some estimates suggest over 99% of web pages are broken. If this is true, I find it amazing that we can do any surfing at all, but evidently browsers have been designed to overlook these flaws. Since some developers believed that this should be cleaned up, when they developed XML it included a feature called “Draconian error handling” that made pages fail if they were broken. The risk of exposing end users to errors resulted in web developers using XML syntax but a MIME type that designated the page as HTML so that browsers would ignore any errors. 

Comments

All of these articles connect with the practice of writing web pages. Duckett's chapters describe the signs and symbols required for the task of writing web pages. They provide the technology and knowledge necessary for building the skill of designing a web page.

Pilgrim's article has a couple points that are relevant to previous readings. He demonstrates the culturally shared knowledge that resulted in the development of HTML5 and reveals the historical context of that development. In his first paragraph he comments on the tension between implementation of specifications and writing of standards. This is very similar to the tension between old and new technology; some people start using the new standards before they have been fully tested just as there are some people who adopt new technology early. He also comments that the development of HTML has been linear. This seems in contrast to Haas's argument that transition from old to new technology is not linear, but Pilgrim mentions that the line was “twisted, knotted, broken” which I believe is how the transition from old to new technology happens.
