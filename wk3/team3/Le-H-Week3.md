## Summaries
_Note: I left my Duckett Book in my locker back at school, which I can't pick up until Monday. For now, I will write a summary on Pilgrim's reading. For the hand coding, I will trying using online resources, then upload a new one as necessary._

The Pilgrim reading, _How Did We Get Here?_ is eactly what it says on the tin, so to speak. This book. or portion of it as Pilgrim describes, goes into detail about the various aspects of HTML's history into being, and the reason how it came to be along with why it exists in HTML5. Rahter than it being completely chronologial in order like the Dilger article on table markup from last week, the chapters are broken up into those parts of HTML, such as MIME declarations and why it allows "broken" HTML. Personally, I like this organization. Now onto the sections.

"Mime types" is an introduction of sorts to how HTML bits work, as mime types are integral to the start of a browser rendering a webpage. Also clled a content type, mime types define the content of a page, such as text. Resources such as images and JavaScript each have their own mime type.

"A long digression into how standards are made" is less technically focused and more of a historical documention to explain the reason for how the standards of HTML exist (and quite effectively too). For this scenario, Pilgrim uses "email archaeology" to find the emails that lead to the standardization of the image element. Essentially, it's a collection of tech experts in java sending messages and replies back and forth that lead to “general-purpose procedural graphics language”, with some helpful context provided by Pilgrim. Since these these considered primary historical sources, it's an interesting insight to how something like standardization is adopted.

"An unbroken line" starts off with a bulleted list of things for the reader to consider after reading the previous section about web standards. Many of them are relevant facts that bring the reader up to speed from that 19-year-old email correspondance to the present. Pilgrim also contemplates on the subject of "shipping" code, which is the code that wins and is satandardized, in other words.

"A timeline of HTML Development from 1994 to 2004" is a bit of a misleading title, in my opinion. But that's only with the previous sections in mind, since the last two had unorthodox formats. The purpose of this "timeline" is to introduce the creation of XHTML by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is HTML 4.0 reformulated with the rules of the markup language XML, also by W3C. The reason isn't explained in detail, save for W3C having given up on the old form of HTML, and would prefer to start anew so that XML can be more easily implements. That said, the second reason why I found this title misleading is that while it indeed concerns the "development" of HTML, it's more about XHTML and how HTML 4 was dropped off.

"Everything you know about XHTML is wrong", now that's an interesting and attention-grabbing title. Mime types are brought up once more, to introduce the problem of website with forgiven, but broken code. As in, a webpage's coding would very likely be flawed, but the rendering would usually overlook any problems and not display errors. This was a problem according to W3C, who mandated "well-formedness" in a website with their new XHTML application. Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, this mandate was not well-received, as error pages would be rampant and common, rendering websites useless. To get past the unforgiving XHTML parser, a loophole involving the mime types was utilised to use the HTML parser instead. 

"A competing vision" details another important event in the thrilling history of HTML. A workshop was held by W3C in 2004, with interested groups, importantly those behind the Mozilla Firefox and Opera browsers, presenting a new vision for the web's future. It involves evolving the standards of HTML 4 that still existed despite the encouragement of XHTML, and an evolution that would include modern app developers. Seven principles were listed to make this vision work, including matters such as backwards compatibility, error handling, practicality, scripting, and an open profile. However, W3C held a poll on the subject then later put in a summary of the workshop that they had no plans for this vision. As a result, the people who wished to evolve the standards of HTML and XML created their own group: the WHAT Working Group.

"WHAT Working Group?" describes this open and unofficial collaboration of Web browser companies and interested parties. Their aim was to create specifications for HTML technologies that would extend HTML 4's features while allowing for backwards compatibility, as X-forms like XHTML were not backwards compatible. This would require a considerable amount of work and dedication so that the various browsers would all be compatible with each other. It took five years, in fact, until the WHAT group documented the method of parsing HTML that would never have the consumer handle an error on the page.

"Back to the W3C" and "Postscript" conclude this chapter with a quiet admission of defeat from the W3C. The WHAT Working Group's HTML extension project had picked up speed while their own XHTML 2.0 was in the mere drafting stages. In 2006, the founder of the W3C declared that the group would then work with the WHAT group to evolve HTML. Using a specification that the WHAT Group had been working on amidst their larger endeavor, originally called Web Applications 1.0, which then became HTML 5.0, thus answering this chapter's title question, "How did we get here?"
