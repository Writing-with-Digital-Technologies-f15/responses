## Summary

### How Did We Get Here

Pilgrim had a really thorough take on how some key elements in HTML5 came to be.  The largest segment of the article was devoted to how the writers of the web got to decide on the <IMG> element, what it was called and how it was used.  It basically came down to whoever ships the code, tends to get theirs to be the standard.  But then we learned about more of the politics and movements inside the W3C and how we’ve gotten to which languages get the most use.  I do like that there was still a place for HTML even with the rise of XML and its incorporation into an earlier incarnation of HTML.  But I think it was important that the lack of perfect coding didn’t slow down the entire internet.

### Duckett
Ch 1
The first chapter describes essentially what we’re going to be learning about in this book.  I appreciate how the chapters will be structured, and even in this first chapter, it does a good job of describing what HTML is and how it works.

Ch 2
Here we went through a lot of coding for writing itself.  There were some elements which I didn’t realize were going to be necessary until I started reading this book.  Aspects such as citations and “add and delete” are elements that I don’t use that much in my everyday writing, and it was surprising to me that they were necessary to code in HTML.

Ch 3
This chapter talked about the different kinds of lists and ways in which you can use them.  We’re starting to see how everything in HTML builds on itself.  What I’m curious to do more with is the “h ref” attribute of certain elements.  It’s cool to see in what ways you can alter them by putting something new inside that specific element.

Ch 4
Here Duckett discusses how to create a piece of text with a hyperlink, either to some other web page, some other website, or even some other part of the page which you are on.  Having worked on web publishers before, I’ve always gotten how to “make” hyperlinks, so it’s really interesting to see how the hyper-text itself actually makes that happen.  We start to see how to be efficient with a building a site, and how HTML helps you create one quickly, such as being able to create links to different pages in a site without even having created a name for it yet.
