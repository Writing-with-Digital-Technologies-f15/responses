## Summary of How Did We Get Here?:
In this text, Pilgrim discusses the history of the Web and HTML, specifically HTML5. It covers topics like MIME types, HTML versus XHTML and the creation of the ‘<img>’ tag and gives a history of how people developed HTML from 1993 to 2004. Pilgrim also discusses the influence of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the development of HTML and how the organization wanted to phase out HTML in favor of the newer XHTML, which was an unpopular and ultimately fruitless move.
MIME types, Pilgrim explains, refers to the kind of content to be found on a web page. This data is read to the browser so that it knows to render the right kind of content. MIME types can refer to text, JavaScript files, any number of image file extensions, CSS stylesheets and more. It’s safe to assume that any kind of web content will have a MIME type. Personally, I didn’t know about MIME types before. I’m surprised that I’ve used the internet for so long and yet not known about this essential part of making the whole operation work.
Pilgrim had an interesting analogy for the path HTML has taken as programmers have created it and evolved it over time: “HTML is an unbroken line. A twisted, knotted, snarled line, to be sure.” (Pilgrim) He means that HTML, while certainly having its share of twists and turns along the way, has kept the same core values and functionality the whole time. This is another fascinating point of the article; the internet, as indispensable as it is in our daily lives, runs on code that has essentially stayed the same since its inception. That was contrary to my expectations, to be sure.
Another point of interest in Pilgrim’s article is XHTML and its existence alongside standard HTML. Pushed along by the W3C, the defining feature of XHTML that I pulled from the article is that it had far more stringent error handling than standard HTML. HTML was willing to fill in missing tags and other minor coding errors to keep a page running smoothly. The W3C thought this was enabling coders to be lazy, so a key element of XHTML-designed pages was to stop working upon encountering an error. It’s no surprise to me that this wasn’t even a little bit popular back then. Also not surprising was the decision of many web developers to use a loophole to continue working with an HTML-based MIME type within XHTML. After reading about MIME types earlier in the reading, it was nice to see them in action as explained in this section.


## Summary of HTML & CSS Introduction: 
Before describing HTML and CSS, the author includes an introduction chapter that explains the basics of how websites are created and how people access the Web in order to give a framework of HTML and CSS. This information serves as context for the main content of the book. To summarize, basic, small web pages are created using HTML and CSS. Larger pages may turn to other web tools such as content management systems and programming languages. Users access the many pages on the web using web browsers, which communicate with the web servers that host the pages. 

## Summary of HTML & CSS Chapter 1:
Chapter 1 is all about the structure of Web pages and how HTML influences that structure. Duckett shows the primary HTML elements that most Web pages use to form their structure, such as ‘<html>’, ‘<body>’ and ‘<head>’. The ‘<html>’ tag denotes a string of text and code that is to be HTML. The ‘<body>’ tag represents the page’s main content and ‘<head>’ refers to the web page heading, the string of text at the top. These tags remain invisible on the web page itself, serving only ti position the content and make it work. There is also a quick primer on how to create a text file that displays as a Web page.

## Summary of HTML & CSS Chapter 4:
Chapter 4 is on the use of links on Web pages and how to form them with HTML tags. Duckett explains how links are important to the structure of the web because they enable users to move between different pages. Links are created with HTML’s ‘<a>’ element. The element refers to an attribute called href, whose stored value is the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page the creator wants to link to. He also demonstrates different kinds of links: those that link to other sites and those that link to other pages on one site. These links can be further manipulated by the site’s creator, able to link to specific points on a web page through the use of headings and id attributes.
