##HTML & CSS Introduction by Jon Duckett

The introduction introduces us to the layout of the pages in the book. It also gives an overview of how the book is structured. Duckett goes on to discuss how we access the web through browsers, web servers, and screen readers. CSS and HTML are used to create web sites and can also include technologies such as content management systems and blogging software (p. 8). 

##HTML & CSS Chapter 1: Structure

The first chapter discusses the importance of structure. The structure of a site will typically resemble a real life object to help users navigate and sort out content (p. 15). HTML also describes the structure of a website through tags, also called elements. Tags are used to describe the information within it. An opening tag consists of a left- and right-angle bracket and a character. A closing tag has those same features along with a forward slash (p. 23-24). Content written between <body> tags and <head> tags, for example, will be shown in different sections of a web site (p. 27). 

Tags can also have attributes, which provides additional information about the tag. Duckett uses the lang attribute as an example, which provides information that the content within that tag will be in English (p. 25). 

##HTML & CSS Chapter 4: Links

Chapter four discusses how links enable browsing (p. 76). Links are created using the <a> tag and href attribute. To link to a website, the url of that website would be inserted after the href attribute. Duckett also explains some ways to use links. For example, linking to a page from the same website (p. 83). 

I found both chapters of Duckett’s book to be really interesting. He breaks down and explains how tags and links are used to create websites. Duckett’s explanations are very easy to understand and the examples he provides helped me to understand how tags and links work. 

##How Did We Get Here? By Mark Pilgrim

Mark Pilgrim discusses how HTML5 was created and why it was created. He emphasizes the importance of understanding MIME types, which help to classify information on a site/page and relay that to a browser (MIME types). Pilgrim then provides a timeline of how HTML was developed from 1997 to 2004. HTML 4.0 was created in 1997 and not too long after, XML 1.0 was also released. 

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) then developed XHTML 1.0, which was a combination of XML and HTML to reflect some of the changes XML proposed. W3C wanted to eliminate broken HTML pages, which had errors in its markup but would not be visibly seen in browsers. This meant that these errors were not being fixed. XML did not allow these errors to occur and treated it seriously. This is called draconian error handling. XHTML adopted this method, though it proved to be unsuccessful. 

The WHAT Working Group was formed in 2004 and worked towards merging HTML and HTML forms. While W3C wanted to focus on developing XHTML. Both groups eventually came together to develop a new HTML.
