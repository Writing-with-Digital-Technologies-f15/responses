## Introduction | HTML & CSS
The introduction to this book starts with briefly talking about the three different parts the book is sectioned into: HTML, CSS, and Practical. It then goes into different ways people access the web including: browsers, web servers, devices, and screen readers. This section of the books concludes with how the web works, which is interesting because it is a process not many people think about day-to-day even though they may access the web frequently. You are connected to the web via an ISP or Internet Service Provider then proceed to type in a web address. Your computer helps you with finding the location of the web server by connecting to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, which acts like a phone book looking up the needed IP address. The specific number that the DNS server looks up lets your browser contact it and proceed to the website. 

## Chapter 1: Structure | HTML & CSS
Many structures for web page design are used to imitate print media in an electronic form. This helps the reader better understand the information on the page. In case of a word document, there is a hierarchy of information and even as I am writing now I am using this technique by making the headers larger than the text to showcase their importance. HTML code is made up of what are known as **elements** – characters that exist within brackets. These elements are bookended by tags: an opening tag and a closing **tag** containing an extra forward slash. **Attributes** tell more information about elements and are made up of a **name** and **value**. For example, the attribute lang, also the name, can be used to specify the page is in English with the value “en-us”. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and the three main tags used in HTML are `<body>`, `<head>`, and `<title>`.  Duckett explains how to make a simple webpage on a Mac and PC including the elements previously defined. The chapter ends with a section on CMS, or content management system, which allows for users to alter one part of a page instead of changing the entire page.

## Chapter 4: Links | HTML & CSS
Links are what enables the idea of browsing or surfing the web and begin with the `<a>` element. Anything between the `<a>` tag is clickable. **Link text** tells visitors where they will be directed to so it is important to have a clear link text. The `<a>` element has an attribute called **href** and the value of this attribute is where users will be taken. A specific URL, or Uniform Resource Loader, is attributed to every web page. An **absolute** URL is defined as the full web address for a site and this is equivalent to the value of the href attribute. A **relative** URL directs users to other pages within the same site. The book explains how it’s a good idea to organize code by directories for larger websites. The structure of a directory has a top-level folder known as a **root** folder, which contains a file called _index.html_ that is the homepage for the entire site. It also contains individual folders for different sections of the site. Each sub-directory has its own index.html file. Email links are also mentioned in this chapter, describing how to create a link that starts up a user’s email program and specifies who an email is directed to. This is possible using the `<a>` element and starting the href attribute with `mailto:` followed by the desired email address. For opening links in a new window, the value should be set to `_blank`. 

## How Did We Get Here?
Pilgrim begins the article with some technical details. He describes that the MIME type or content type of a page describes how the browser interprets the page markup. The header **Content-Type** is used to define the markup and in the case of html it would look like this: Content-Type: text/html. Pilgrim goes back in time to the creation of html to answer questions of today’s markup. He does this through emails from designers who were discussing a way to insert images without having to use code. The article explained the results of these discussions, such that some of these ideas were used and are still around. Pilgrim addresses a timeline of HTML development and how people wanted to change its standards, but markup tools such as XML and XHTML were too strict and had a estimated error rate of 99% on existing pages. He concludes the article with a section on the WHAT Working Group whose goal is develop specifications based on HTML. 

## An Introduction to Browser Rendering
In this video, Hansa describes how a web page is rendered. To show this, Hansa presents a diagram with the following order: HTML, DOM (document object model), render tree, layout, paint. The render tree is combines DOM and CCSOM (CSS object model) and only contains the nodes that are going to be rendered, leaving out elements such as a header. Even an element on a page as simple as a square has an intricate painting process that includes its rotation, height, width, and borders.
