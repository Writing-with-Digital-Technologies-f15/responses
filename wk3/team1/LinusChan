## How did we get here? 

The article, “how did we get here” is a study and analysis of the creation of HTML scripts, primarily the <img> script. The author discusses how individuals, like Marc Andressesn would propose various ways in order to implement new things on browsers. These ways would organically coexist with each other on the internet, existing on various different servers and browsers. However, these ways would get thinned out through “retro-spec” advancements in HTML technology. These advancements were the formalization of features that existed in HTML and were most commonly used. They also were capable of full backward computability. 

	This became a picture of how HTML develop in a multitude of ways. Of how various computer scientists would propose a concept, implement it on their own server and see the adoption of new technique around the world. If these concepts were popular enough, they could be “retro-spec”ed into the codified HTML technology and exist into the modern day. The author ends this by stating, “The ones that win are the ones that ship.” Essentially, if there are new concepts to code that need to be implemented, going over it year on year won’t make it an essential piece of HTML. The purity of the style or lack of conciseness wasn’t the most important requirement. In order to get retro-spec’d, in order to be adopted as a whole, it had to be popular, easy to use and to make sense.


##An Introduction to Browser Rendering. 

This video was an brief overview of how a browser was actively rendered. It showe the different paths, how they would converge in one way and take time to load and fill out the content. These two paths were stated to be the HTML path and the CSS path. The HTML path laid out the framework while the CSS Path would contain a content informaton. Both of these paths would lead into the render tree, which would take infomation from both of the paths in order to create the desired web browser image. At the end, we saw how a computer actively rendered the scripts.
