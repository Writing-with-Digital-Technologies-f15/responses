## HTML and CSS - Chapter 1 & 4

Chapter 1 reviewed the basic HTML elements and code, providing descriptions on page 22. It was also revealed that content management systems were given tools that allowed edits to be made to parts of a page instead of editing an entire page. This allows for those who are not familiar with HTML to add information. 

Chapter 4 reviewed the editing of links in an HTML code. It was noted that links are important to the web because it enables the idea of browsing and surfing. When writing links, it is best to niclude link text that explains where visitors will go when clicked. Clear link texts results in happier audiences. Absolute URLs and relative URLs were also defined. An absolute URL links to a different website, whereas a relative URL links to other pages within the same site.

I remembered being given this advice when I first started learning basic coding, and it was nice to be reminded of this learning technique in chapter 1: viewing the source code of other web pages. I also remember having a lot struggles when I started learning HTML, and writing links was one of them, mainly linking to folders in the directory.
