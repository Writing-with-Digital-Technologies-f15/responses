## Task Analysis
### STUDENT GOAL:
Publish a post to Writing-with-Digital-Technologies-f15 repository on Github through Prose.io

###TASKS
REQUIRES-
- device with internet connectivity
- github account
- authoriziatino of prose to post to github

Write a post on Prose by selecting a sub folder (and possibly another folder within that sub folder) to submit to and then selecting "new file" and providing a descriptive name to your post

###MENTAL/PHYSICAL STEPS

Mental: understand the instructions for the writing assignment and plan out construction. come up with a descriptive title for your document

Physical: take a laptop/ computer/ internet connected device and type the post on prose.io

###WHO?

Individuals with a rudimentary working knowledge of computers that are enrolled in WRIT 4662W for the Fall 2015 term.

###WHEN/WHAT CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY?

The invidiuals must have set up prose.io and github properly and have either pre-written their response or know what thehy would like to write about. The user cannot post if they have an internet connectivity issue or have not planned out their assignment. They will usually be at home, in a coffee shop, the library, or another "study space" when posting. 

###DISTRACTIONS

- internet connectivity issues
- student deletes the "md" at the end of the file name (a mistake I have, sadly, made)
- cat videos on tumblr deter productivity

###NEED TO KNOW
The actual posting should not take more than 90 seconds; however, if the user has not previously composed their post, it can take much longer depending on the length of the assignment. 

The layout is fairly intituitve. I believe that both beginners and advanced users can figure out how to navigate the site. 

The frequency of the posts will vary depending on how often assignments are given out: ~ 1 per week.
