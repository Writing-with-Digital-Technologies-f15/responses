##Introduction
HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett

First of all, I'd like to point out how visually appealing and readable this textbook is.  The content is arranged in neatly snackable chunks that make it easily consumable. 

This introduction gives a bit of a state of the union of the web and some background information on the technologies that are used day-to-day on the Internet, such as different web browsers. I had never heard of the browser Opera, but perhaps it is more common in the UK (some of the words used in Duckett's text are written in British English). This background provided is then followed by instructional information on what specific roles HTML and CSS are best suited for and how the web functions at the most basic level.  Through providing the reader with this basic information on what exactly each of the languages does and then proceeding to supply information on the bare bones structure of the internet, Duckett offers a solid foundation on which to build in the future chapters 

##Chapter 1
HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett

InChapter 1 Duckett describes the importance of structure to the field of web page design. Using side-by-side comparisons of print media and their web counterparts (namely,the _Guardian_), he drives home the point that many forms of electronic media mirror their print media counterparts. Using HTML elements, or tags, you can further examine the structure of a webpage. HTML, like any other language, can be translated. Through looking at the values within the attributes of the HTML, a browser can translate the code into a structured webpage. 

In this chapter Duckett provide rudimentary knowledge of HTML. The reader learns about the body, head, and title tags and sees samples of webpages composed using those tags. I enjoyed that Duckett offered instructions for putting together pages in both Windows and OSX operating systems.

##Chapter 4
HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett

This chapter explores links. Links are obviously an important piece of building a  webpage because without links it isn't truly an _inter_ net. To create a link, you use the tag “a” and define the destination of the link with “href”, which stands for “hypertext reference”.   Duckett explains how to link to an outside site, another page on your site, a specific point on a page, and how to link to an email. Duckett also includes information on the preferred methods for making links—-ie: it’s not a best practice to have all your links open in a new window without telling people first. 

I like that Duckett also takes time to describe how to best organize your site. He explains the specific aspects of organization such as folders, root folders, sub-directories, and the various relationships between all of them. It is only after explaining the layout of a site that Duckett finally describes what a URL is—a uniform resource loader. This sequence is extremely helpful in ensuring that the reader is gaining a comprehensive understanding of web page design. 


##How Did We Get Here 
by Mark Pilgrim

Pilgrim discusses the path that was taken to arrive at HTML as we know it (or knew it—this article is about four years old).

First of all, I just want to say that I really appreciate how Pilgrim has laid out his piece. The cute illustrations, large headings, and break up of larger chunks of text are very beneficial to the reader’s understanding of the material. 

Pilgrim describes the motivation behind developing HTML (think image files) and provides background information on MIME types, which are used to classify information and translate that classification to a web browser. The classification would be a MIME type. 

The article provides history behind the creation of HTML and XML, including the workings of the WC3 and the WHAT Group (a more recently formed group working with the goal to improve HTML).  Pilgrim describes how HTML is still in use many years later. This is fascinating to me because of the seemingly linear way in which the technology progressed. In Week 2, we spent a significant chunk of time discussing the fact that relationships between old and new technology are not linear, but this would seem to be an exception to the rule.
