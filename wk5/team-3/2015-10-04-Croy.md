## Summary of Haas chapter
	In this chapter Haas describes the selection of scroll bar features and menu behavior. The article is an interesting chronicle of the decisions made and the interactions between people that occur on such a project.  The significant tension over which features and functions should go into the scroll bars and menus clearly illustrates that features of technology are not inevitable. Software engineers and designers were frustrated by the criticisms coming from the user advocates, and the user advocates found that the designers were not very responsive to their concerns. However, once the director showed support for their ideas, the designers payed them a little more attention. 
	One incident is an example of how technology changes the person, which is part of the mediational means definition. A member of the team decided to implement one of the scroll bar designs and not give advanced users customization options. At first, the advanced users were disgruntled, but once they were used to it, they accepted it and acknowledged its superiority over the existing design (p154). 

## My responses
	I was not sure after reading this what part of the chapter was related to the different parts of the title. Was the “Scientific Truth” the fact that the designers all had a background in computer science? Or was it the usability study which showed that people did better with what they were familiar with? 
	The social dynamics are pretty clear – the user advocates had low status. The middle finger pointer offended some users and given the cultural environment (in the US and in the 80’s) the designers should not have been surprised that some people found it offensive. Was the pointer a deliberate inclusion by the designers, or were they so out of touch socially that they didn’t realize this might be offensive? 
	Another part of this article I didn’t really understand was what Haas meant by planning when using computers (as opposed to pen and paper) was more at the local level than the conceptual level (p.138). What does she mean by “local level” in writing? Sentence structure and spelling? It seems to me that given a task, and the use of only one tool, either pen and paper or a computer, there would be little difference between them. 

## HTML5
	Older browsers do not recognize some aspects of HTML5, so website designers must be aware of these aspects and include workarounds in their HTML5 code. Pilgrim points out that older browsers will often ignore the content-type header in a process called “content sniffing.” (p. 2) Ignoring this header allows older browsers to render the page correctly, but may make pages susceptible to security breaches. (p. 12) Ducket explains that HTML5 allows formatting a whole block as a link, but older browsers are not equipped to handle this feature, so these browsers will often interpret the code as an inline element. Ducket provides code to instruct older browsers to render it correctly. (p. 441) In addition, some versions of Internet Explorer before 9 require Javascript to understand any CSS applied to the new HTML5 elements. Ducket provides code for this purpose as well. (p. 442)
	THE HTML5 Boilerplate documentation specifies some elements to make sure pages are rendered correctly and securely. One of these is to make sure that the charset meta is included within the first 1024 bytes of the page and as early as possible. The compatibility mode meta must be included before other elements with the exception of <title> and any other metas.  The page must also include this compatibility mode statement, either as a meta tag or an HTTP response header. This ensures that Internet Explorer always renders the page with its latest engine.

## Historicizing sources
	I’m considering historicizing either digital presentations (i.e. PowerPoint) or adoption of CSS. My first source discusses how PowerPoint makes presenters more concerned with the cosmetic aspect of their presentations, limits their ability to do rigorous analysis, and give intelligent technical presentations. I am interested in deeper investigation of this partly because it is consistent with Haas’s argument that technologies change us (in this case presumably by “dumbing us down”) and partly because I disagree with the view that PowerPoint limits technical discussion. One of the author’s arguments is that less information can be presented with a static slide using bullet points than with a written report or a speech (without PowerPoint slides). I am interested in seeing whether animated presentation software, such as Powtoon, provides greater information density in presentations.
	My second source is a presentation whose purpose was to persuade people to use CSS instead of tables. If I choose this topic for my historicizing project, the source will serve as a starting point to trace how tables have been used less and less in the design of web pages over the last ten years. Similar to Haas’s description of city offices that were resistant to using web technology, I would like to learn why there was resistance to using CSS instead of tables.
