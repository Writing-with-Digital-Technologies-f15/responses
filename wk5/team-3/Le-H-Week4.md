## Haas Chapter 6
Haas overviews the previous chapter by commenting on the nature of writing and literary technologies, of which she discerned in previous chapeters. Some qualities include how it is not self-determining, and instead determined by humans themselves. Writing is also a psycholgical tool, and despite the differences in medium between handriting and computer-writing, the differences in the way a human's mind would get involved with those activities were not too different. Haas then goes on to explain that for most, what people consider the computer and computer writing tools at work is actually its interface. People do not think beyond to the how's and why's of computer features, so Haas uses her experience with the Andrew Project at Carnegie Mellon to demonstrates the complexities behind the development of even the most mundane of features. The two in particular are the menus and scroll bar features of the interface. Because it was developed on a college campus and accesible to many users including the students and staff, there was plenty of commentary, complaints and suggestions to go round for its interface. While there was a time when where customization options for the scroll bar, the developer of it then decided that there should be only one, final design while the rest are to be discarded. This was a radical idea at the time due to the original technology philosophy of providing choices for users, but over time people became accustomed to it. The history of menus in the Andrew Project also faced difficulties, as Haas recounts them. The menu sets underwent a drastic change in design, which inevitably led to mixed opinions. Even with a study performed, it could not be discerned which design was the better of the two, only that whichever the subject used first was easier for them to use compared to the other one. There is an emphasis by Haas on the value of a technology's history such as this. These two examples of of a technology's history disprove what Haas believes are the big myths of technology with self-determination and transparency. The development of technologies, in other words, has many factors that would go into it, and even then, complete "improvement" cannot be ensured.

##Duckett Chapter 17
This chapter in our HTML and CSS textbook is about HTML5. I already know a little bit about it from Pilgrim's writing, but that was more of a historical context to its emergence (technology and its own history seem to be a running theme here) in the present day. The chapter start off as usual with a little introduction, stat the HTML 5 intoduces new elements that that help with the structural design of a page. Appropriately, the next set of pages compare the labeling of HTML elements in a traditional HTML layout and the new way that HTML5 labels these arrangements. Originally on traditional HTML layouts, web page authors had to use the &lt;div&gt; element in order to arrange the elements of a web page into proper groups. HTML5 gives some of these &lt;div&gt; elements names of their own as elements, such as &lt;div id="nav"&gt; becoming &lt;nav&gt;. Next in this chapter are the new individual elements that HTML introduces. They include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt;. Interestingly enough, the &lt;div&gt; can still be used to froup things up in HTML5 still. The chapter also notes that for older browsers that would not recognize the new specifications of HTML5, a line of CSS should be included to state which of these new elements should be rendered as block elements. As usual, the end of this chapter includes examples of an HTML5 layout all written out, as well as a summary going over the important things for reader to take out of this chapter.
