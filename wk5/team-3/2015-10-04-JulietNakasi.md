## HTML 5

Using HTML5 on older browsers will ignore the new elements because older browsers won’t be accustomed with the new elements. Therefore, instead of using them properly as desired, they will be treated as inline elements. Duckett provides a specific CSS line that can be used to help older browsers to understand what you are trying to do. The CSS line outlines the different elements that are used in HTML5. Once these elements are listed in the CSS line, older browsers will acknowledge them and use them the way they are supposed to be used. Duckett also mentions that in order to use the CSS line, one should also have JavaScript.  Other wise without JavaScript, the older browsers would not be able to implement the CSS, and hence the new elements in HTML5 won’t be implemented either. 

## Summary of Haas Article

In this article Haas shows that technologies are “evolving and fluid but nonetheless powerful cultural system…” (Haas, 1995, p. 165) Before she goes into detail illustrating that particular point and dismissing the few myths about technology that are always thrown out, at the beginning of the article she lays foundation of the cultural system. She talks about how Vygotsky was interested in the cultural systems. This part helps to explain the context of the cultural system. In the Vygotskian concept she helps us understand the way different technologies revolve around cultural systems. 

In the article she explains the process that went into the development and design of the scroll bar, and how different people were involved in the process. She talks about the disagreements that went into the entire process. But ultimately people were forced to adapt to the new version when all the old versions were taken away from the system. She also talks about the menu development and design. Moving it from right to left, the objections that each one faced, and how the manager decided on going with one over the other.  She mentions in the article that the development and design of the menu bar didn’t face many obstacles as the scroll bar.  We get a clear sense of how different versions worked and how different people viewed them by making different comments (both good and bad) about them. She was involved in the process. Therefore, she got first hand knowledge through the development and design of both.

The explanation of these process helps lead to her main point, which was to rebuke the myths that “ all technology is powerful, and … transparent.” (Haas, 1995, p. 163) She disputes these myths by pointing to different parts of the Andrew project.  In the end she gives what she considers as the proper definition of technology, which can be seen as something that is always changing, and involves different “voices” and processes. She says “… some of them contradictory but all of them interested.” (Haas, 1995, p. 165) This explains that even if the voices in the process may not always agree on something, they are all in some way important in the process. 

## Historicizing Pitch

For this project, one thing that I would really want to do is researching the ‘figure’ ‘figcaption’ elements in the new HTML5.  Being able to add a caption to a figure was very intriguing when I discovered that we could do it in HTML5

The other web technology that I am interested in is ‘hgroup’ element in HTML5. I considered this technology after reading chapter 17. Heading groupings could be beneficial when writing long HTML code for different sites.

And the third one is CSS Reset. This is a new one I got when I looked at one of the links that were suggested for the historicizing project. It looked like something that would be very fun and rewarding to historicize. 

**What practices are linked to this technology: tools, community knowledge and values, & skills?**

The ‘figure’ element is used to reference things like images, videos, graphs, diagrams etc. in HTML5. The ‘figcaption’ element is used to provide a text description of the figure referenced. 

The ‘hgroup’ element is used to group different ‘h’ elements together so that instead of being interpreted as separate elements, they are all interpreted as one.

And finally the CSS Reset are the rules that reset the styling of HTML elements and makes them look the way the person designing the website wants them to look. It also helps to keep things consistent for all the pages.

**What competing issues or trends are you interested in investigating in more detail? Why?**

For the ‘figure’ and ‘figcaption’ element, I want to investigate if the way it is used in HTML5 differs a lot from how the images were used in other html versions. I also want to investigate whether the ‘figcaption’ really makes a difference to the viewers. Do the users really care about the caption explaining the figure used, and is it necessary to have a caption for all the figures that are referenced in the code? Personally, I think it’s cool that we can add a caption in text to an image, video, or diagram but is it really necessary to have the caption on every single one of the figures? That’s why this particular web technology interested me.

For the ‘hgroup’, when I read chapter 17 and discovered that it can be possible to group the ‘h’ in the code, and that when they are grouped they will be interpreted as one, that caught my attention. Therefore, I would love to investigate the advantage of grouping them versus having them as individual elements in the code in detail. I want to know if there is more to it than just the styling to make the code look readable.

And lastly for the CSS Reset, when I read about what it does and how helpful it can be to implement it in my code, I became very intrigued about it. I really don’t know much about it. Therefore, that is the main reason why I would consider investigating it. I think understanding how to use it in more detail could be very beneficial to me. I read about it and know what it does, but I want to understand if there are instances when it would be vital to implement the CSS Reset.
