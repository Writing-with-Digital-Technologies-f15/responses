## Summary of Haas’ article
In her article “Social Dynamics, or Scientific Truth, or Sheer Human Cussedness,” Haas expresses the idea that the way web pages and user interfaces turn out is often the result of many complex decisions and influences and politics from different groups of people. She demonstrates this idea by discussing her time as a member of the User Interface Group working on the Andrew Project, a “prototype educational computing system” at Carnegie Mellon University (Haas 141–43).  
To begin, Haas explains how Vygotsky’s meditational method theories tie into her experiences with Andrew. Vygotsky sees writing as a culmination of sign systems, gathered from outside influences and cultural factors, to create tools that are used for communication of thought and developing literacy (Haas 138–39). Haas then states that, in order to fully understand these meditational tools, one must explore their origins and the various factors that led to their development (Haas 139). In specific, Haas decides to talk about the complex process that led to how the scroll bars and menus in Andrew came to be the way they are.
The scroll bars were originally made one way, but then a group of user advocates—who had tested the scroll bars with users and found that they were perhaps more difficult and confusing to use than necessary—suggested some alterations (Haas 151). Andrew’s ITC was astounded that such a big part of Andrew’s layout, the scroll bar, could be changed from what they were familiar with and used to just because a group with a much smaller influence and voice wanted them to change (Haas 152). As a result, other members of the ITC submitted ideas for a new scroll bar in order to be involved in the process (Haas 151–52). There was a lot of contention surrounding the subject (Haas 151). Eventually, a particular scroll bar design was agreed upon by a group, and their decision was influenced by Morris, the director of the ITC (Haas 153, 163). One developer built the new scroll bar, and he did not leave any customizable options with it, which upset some more of the advanced users because they thought customization was very important for an interface (Haas 153). 
Next, Haas talks about the types of menus that were developed before the ITC came to the one that they ended up using. Most notable was the stack of cards menu which had some downsides like taking up a lot of space and they were sometimes difficult to use (Haas 159). A new “left stacking menu was created and caused some complaints from the ITC, who had gotten used to the card stacking menus (Haas 161). Haas had to conduct a user test to find out which one users preferred and the results were kind of mixed (Haas 162). Finally the User Interface Group leader made a decision between the two (he chose the left stacking menus) sort of because of the test results but also because he just preferred them (Haas 162). 
Haas’s main purpose in talking about these two elements of the Andrew product was to show that just because one certain way of developing something wins out doesn’t mean it is the “best.” It just means that that is the course things went based on many different factors and decisions by groups of people who have different ideas and goals in mind (Haas 140). This ties in with the discussion in her other article about viewing technology too simply. It is easy to assume that the way an interface looks is the best or only way, but that is very rarely the case. In addition, interfaces typically don’t eliminate all aspects of old technology when a new element is created. Like the new scroll bar still retained some similarities to the old one, and the left stacking menus still stacked rather than being part of a drop down menu. Technology is a compilation of both user and creator influences, and these influences don’t just come out of nowhere but are a result of the environment and culture around them. 

## Duckett ch 17 
Duckett’s chapter “HTML 5 Layout” in HTML and CSS details the ways that html 5 has changed from the previous version. One important difference is that there are new elements like “header” or “article” or “aside” where once these were simply div attributes (Duckett 432). In order to allow old versions of browsers to read html 5 CSS, a JavaScript link must be included in the head element so the browser can process the CSS information correctly (Duckett 444). The CSS does not “[group] items using div elements,” but rather utilizes the less complex html 5 elements to design the way each segment of a web page looks (Duckett 444).   

## Historicizing Pitches 
My first pitch is for the CSS element “Center,” or if that is too narrow than just general CSS alignment strategies. Centering is used not only on the web but also in print media, and it is important for creating a hierarchy in a text—making a title, heading, or other information stand out to a reader. “Center” is a web design tool that can also serve to make a page look more organized, appealing, and readable. It creates a balance on a page that is sometimes desired by a designer in order to get their point across. An aspect of community knowledge regarding “Center” is that, when a reader sees a centered line in the middle of a sea of text, they know it is probably a heading or something else that requires attention and focus. It is the designer’s job to gain the necessary design skills to put alignment tools to the best possible use to create a web page that is easy to read and looks balanced. There are choices between right and left alignment and centered, and those are decisions a designer must make when writing CSS. I would like to explore the development of the “Center” element and how/how often it is generally used by web designers today. Is left alignment favored for headings? Does center really make text stand out? What challenges are involved with the “Center” element?

My second pitch is to learn about the hgroup element in html5. It is a new tool in html5 and according to Duckett many designers disregard it. I would like to explore why it was developed, how it can be used, and how it is helpful in writing code. Does the community of designers generally prefer hgroup or separate headings? Does hgroup limit any uses of headings? Why does this community feel the way it does about hgroup? Hgroup is sort of a hidden element: a reader does not see it being used. So the skills behind it belong mainly to the designers who choose whether or not to use it.
