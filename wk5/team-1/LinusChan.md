##Summary of Haas (1996), "Social dynamics, or scientific truth, or sheer human cussedness: Design decisions in the evolution of a user interface"

	Christine Haas in, Social dynamics, argues that the history of computer interface is and has always been incredibely dynamic. She utilizes her Vygotskian concept of mediational means to analyze the development of the scroll  bar and the menu bar in Andrew, a pre-cursor to the personal computer, which was situated in Carnegie Melon University. This Vygotksian concept of mediational means, posits that the act of writing is a tool, a medium ground, that provides an avengue for certain kinds of thoughts. Haas jumps off this concept and makes this distinction. That writing with pen and writing on a computer have different 'middle' grounds and therefore the writer has different kinds of thoughts from using these tools. 
	Armed with Vygotksy and filled with experienential knowledge, Haas dove into the history and the controversy behind the scroll bar and the menu system. These two entities, the scroll bar and the menu system are artifacts that seem to have always existed in internet culture. They're prevelant in any GUI (Graphical User Interface) and are almost invisible in their ubiquity. Nonetheless, Haas tells the story of how these tools have an enormous history, a history fraught with conflict, design changes and the self afflicted, all consuming introspective self-applied test question, "is there better or is this best."
    The design of the scroll bar in Andrew was, to say the least, complicated. With a team of 35 computer scientists, engineers and itinerant social scientists, this project started with diversity and ended with complexity. However, this broad spectrum of people enabled the act of writing on a personal computer to take off. At The very beginning, there were varying opinions in ITC, Information Technology Center, on what to work on, what was important, what was an efficient tool and what was impossible to implement. The User Interface Group that worked on documentation in Andrew was what Haas focused on the most in her historicizing project. 
    A key point of conflict was the user advocate group. These user advocates were consultants who were starkly different to the PHD system designers in computer science and electrical engineering. Instead, these consultants were almost all female who studied humanities. However, backed by the director of the ITC, they were given "three wishes" for the Andrew interface. Through this, the concept of the scroll bar was pushed through. They nonetheless had numerous complaints on other things, but the primary engineers focused on those three wishes. 
    I found this to be incredibely interesting. Without that vocal minority, the act of going through text on the internet would be vastly different. While there are similar concepts of paragraph structure, text managment and even visual displays mirrored from real life into a computer interface, I believe that a scroll bar is quite original. The simple act of scrolling down has become second nature to a computer user now, but in our daily lives, text is hardly ever read through the act of scrolling. Simply put, books come in pages, not in everlasting columns. 
    Yet, these scroll bars came to fruition. There was a huge back and forth as the visual appearance of the scroll bar was changed, precise movements on the navigation was implemented and at times, Haas noted, the concept of customization as a sacred concept was invoked by the engineers. But, come Monday morning, people settled down. They saw the scroll bar and it was an improvement. Once more, the concept of, those who ship, win, reigned supreme. 
    Likewise, the implementation of Menus in Andrew was messy in it's own right. There were issues with menu unwieldiness, middle finger cursor icons and even right stacking menus vs left stacking arguements. These design choices weren't simple and there simply weren't real world examples to derive a coherent bias towards. At times, people who developed muscle memory to menu commands pushed back violently against changes. It was difficult, and some people thought that menus were done completely incorrectly as time progressed. However, one man made the decision. Deemed the Czar, he decided that left stacking would be implemented throughout all of CMU. 
    These various thoughts, emotions and best practices theories were all vital in the creation of the mediation tools that we use today. The history of the GUI isn't an easy one to track down, but it still is a vital one. We might have to fight through "sheer human cussedness" to get things done, but now, more than ever we must realize that all voices are powerful, no matter how much they contradict each other. That the artifacts and tools that we create today, will influence people who use computers and who make huge decisions both now and forevermore. 
    	
##HTML5 Planned obsolescences
	Internet Explorer 5.5
    The watchword of our era should be compatability. As consumers, we believe that customization is sacred and choice is our deity. However, we, in our sheer cussedness, also maintain the belief that we deserve access to everything and anything. So, web designers are tasked with the enormous job of making all things compatable. From Mobile to Internet Explorer, from Netscape Navigator to Firefox, each person expects and continues to expect the same website. In order to do this, javascript has breathed life into compatability. By simply adding in the meta tag, content = ie edge or a meta tag for mobile viewports, HTML5 Boilerplate enables compatability for all  websites. Through HTML5 Boilerplate, obscelence is not something that is as readily considered. While Apple can discontinue old IOS versions, Android with it's own OS, web prowsers can stay despite their legacy. They might have been planned to be obsolete, but we consumers have planted our flag. We wanted our old IE browsers and designers have contoured all of their webpages for us. 
    
##Historicizing

Pedagogy with Game design. 
The origin of Flash 
Game websites such as Miniclips, albino blacksheep, Kongregate, New Grounds

###Flash

http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/

Here's my pitch. I woud like to hisorcize the Flash in general. Due to its largess, my three 'pitches' or web technologies will be connected to Flash. 
There are a numerous amount of practices linked to Adobe Flashplayer. When the package first came out, I remember the huge communities that developed from it. Communities such as Miniclip, Newgrounds, and even Albino Blacksheep were all incredibely popular in the 2000s. Tools centered around flash also abounded. This kickstarted the era of the online calculator, chatrooms and even website forums like Xanga, Myspace and Neopets! 
In contrast, I'm interested in looking at the continued obselecence of flash in modern society. Steve Job's vitriolic article, "thoughts on flash"  really showed the division that begun to appear in it's history. As mobile moved forward, and these mobile devices completely lacked compatability with flash, we saw how website designs changed because of it. A competing trend that evolved, was our very own HTML5! 

Through an analysis of Vygostkyians concepts, I'm curious if Flash influenced the public's understanding of the internet and the younger generation's exposure to it. On a personal basis, I have fond memories of the games that I was able to access through the internet. It became a driving force for why i would log on, how I came to understand drivers, plug-ins and even web browsers. Dare I say, I was educated through gamification?

All jokes laid aside, I'm definitely considering historicizing the rise and downfall of Adobe Flash Player. Whether it's the pedagogy of game design that arose from flash, the origin of Adobe Flash Player or the communities that arose because of that oh-so influential plug-in, I think it's a juicy topic to dig into!
