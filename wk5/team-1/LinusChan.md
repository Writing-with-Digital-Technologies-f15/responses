##Summary of Haas (1996), "Social dynamics, or scientific truth, or sheer human cussedness: Design decisions in the evolution of a user interface"

	Christine Haas in, "Social dynamics", argues that the history of computer interface is and has always been incredibely dynamic. She utilizes her Vygotskian concept of mediational means to analyze the development of the scroll  bar and the menu bar in Andrew, a pre-cursor to the personal computer, which was situated in Carnegie Melon University. This Vygotksian concept of mediational means, posits that the act of writing is a tool, a medium ground, that provides an avengue for certain kinds of thoughts. Haas jumps off this concept and makes this distinction. That writing with pen and writing on a computer have different 'middle' grounds and therefore the writer has different kinds of thoughts from using these tools. 
	Armed with Vygotksy and filled with experienential knowledge, Haas dove into the history and the controversy behind the scroll bar and the menu system. These two entities, the scroll bar and the menu system are artifacts that seem to have always existed in internet culture. They're prevelant in any GUI (Graphical User Interface) and are almost invisible in their ubiquity. Nonetheless, Haas tells the story of how these tools have an enormous history, a history fraught with conflict, design changes and the self afflicted, all consuming introspective test question, "is there better or is this best
