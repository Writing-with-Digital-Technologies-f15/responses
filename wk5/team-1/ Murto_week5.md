## Haas Summary

Haas has written an overview of the development and changes to a user interface of The Andrew Project. She was directly involved in this project, and saw how the menu system and scroll bars changed as the project evolved. Users were not quickly catching on to how to use the scroll bars as they were originally implemented. A singular design created from a hodgepodge of suggestions was implemented. Although not everyone was happy with the selected design, most people agreed it was much improved (154). The menus design took a while to select, and several iterations were made. It was discovered that users were usually happy with any menu configuration. As long at they were consistent throughout the program. Users simply preferred the first type of menu they were shown. In the end, one person made the final decision of which menu type would be used and forced everyone else to use it. Haas uses these examples to make the point that computer technology is fluid, and can change over time, influenced by the surroundings it was developed in.

I like how the two examples provided in Haas's article gave a glimpse into how things evolve. I especially like where the article indicated that there is not necessarily a 'best' way to do things, there just may be a 'better' way. Sometimes the 'best' way isn't possible due to situational constrictions, like making the menus pull-downs (p. 164), and at the same time sometimes things need to change even if a certain audience is used to it, like the scroll bars. I read this article as a version of the historicizing project: it delves into the circumstances around a project that lead to decisions about its implementation. The goal of the project is to map those things out for the writer's chosen topic.

## HTML5

The problem with older browsers is they were made at a time when certain technology did not exist, but they still may be being used today. If a website needs to work on an older browser, newer features cannot always be used. If a browser does not support HTML5 for instance, JavaScript libraries can be imported to let older browsers 'have' these features. The JavaScript libraries will help perform commands that the browser doesn't know how to do it on its own.  Duckett suggests using HTML5 shiv or HTML 5 shim. Our professor has introduced us to HTML5 Boilerplate. All of these enable missing features in older browsers. These JavaScript files can be wrapped in a conditional comment inside the head tag. These comments only runs the code inside of them if the browser matches the condition specified. The downside is not every user has JavaScript enabled, so those users may still be out of luck for seeing the new features.

I am going to historicize the rise and fall of Flash. 

I could also do the HTML5 Video tag as my second technology I'm considering, but I'm pretty set in my decision. I'm excited.

###Why?

I started by thinking about doing my project on live streaming, as I did a project with that at work last year. It was very hard to find resources for that topic though, so I moved on. Then I was going to just something related to web video. Researching that, I kept finding mentions of Flash, which I thought would be quite interesting since it's a dying technology with a thick history.

Most of my focus is going to be in its use for video, although other topics will be addressed. Flash went from being an Internet necessity to being shunned. I thought its history might be interesting to cover, mostly because we're at the end.

###What competing issues or trends are you interested in investigating in more detail?

This will end up tying into HTML5 Video tag development, as lack of mobile support and the HTML 5 tag is what ultimately killed Flash.  I might bring up QuickTime, RealPlayer and other ways of getting video online, but 'in detail' would probably be a distraction. Shockwave and Java Applets might also get brought up when discussing online games/software, but once again, detail would make the project an encyclopedia.

### What practices are linked to this technology?

Video is a very necessary tool. The web is a very commercial device, and being able to communicate through audio or video is a great way to advertise. Flash was the tool to use if you needed video for a very long time. YouTube originally used Flash before moving to HTML5.

Flash certainly takes skills. If you are providing an animation or game, you'll need to learn Action Script. If you are making a streaming video, you'll have to learn how to set up the flash project to display that. It is a web technology not natively integrated into the web. That technology takes special software purchased through Adobe, the skills to use that software, the skills to export what you've made and test it, and the separate skills of putting it online.

The change in community values and knowledge will be something to be explored in the project. As stated, this is a dying technology that at this point has been rejected by its owner Adobe. At one point, it was a foundational element of the Internet, and when Apple announced it wouldn't be supported on it's new iPhone, it was somewhat shocking. That transition is definitely something to explore, and is why I want to do this topic.
