## A New Post

**Haas**
In"Social Dynamics" Haas states "Computer writing systems, like all other writing tools, work one way not another because of institutional history and politics, underlying theories of technology and writing, and human deicison making within a social context." I feel like this serves as the main summary for her argment for computer interface being very dynamic. Haas describes the epitome of the user experience and how people do not necessarily care how their programs are made, but that they run efficiently, yet she contrasts this with Vygotsky, in that to understand an artifact, we must understand its history. Yet I have gleaned from this article that the optimal user experience leaves no room for the user to question who made it, so these ideas reamin in conflict in practice. Despite this, Haas efectively presents the need for understanding the history of user interfaces, and how the best, most functioning of features, like the scroll bar have a deep history. This means more when Haas presents the Andrew Project example and talk about her own experience in developing these 
technologies. 

The development of the scroll bar was complicated. The initial need for the scroll bar derived from a user interface wishlist, which is understandable as it made a page more navigatable, and this development, left to an entire committee, did make a difference. It was complicated to use and to teach others to use, but better than not having a scroll bar at all. Yet, the scroll bar underwent changes, and this is what peaked my interest. When Haas talks about the change of the scroll bar not coming about because of people demanding that it move better, because they really had no point of reference, but from a small committee that thought there was a better way to design it, this sort of brings it back to the quote I referenced earlier because this decision falls in line with underlying theories and human decision making within a social context. Like she says a small group of user adovocates, not even considered a part of the design team, to initiate the change. 

The human decision making idea appears again when she discusses the removal of customiziation in regards to the scroll bar, and designers deciding that all other scroll bar designs and possiblities would be thrown out. This decison of best practice is an integral part of developing a uniform technology in a dynamic technological world.

The menu fiaco was literally a fiasco. With a conflict that was less easy ot solve than that of the scroll bar issue, we sort of get to see how keeping this "free market" and how creating uniformity in the design would be at war with each other. The design pushback and the resistance to change, like in any institution that is trying to become established really came to a head in menus. Yet like the scroll bar, one designer was able to make a decision that would be abided by and bring all menus in the Andrew Project under the same form of creation. 

Haas explains that the building and development of these computer systems was as much susceptible to politics and power struggles as any other instution that is trying to establish itself. Their is a stuggle in the direction of design and development just as much as there is a pushback to change. The dynamics of user interface have a long, complicated history. 

**Duckett**

Duckett explores HTML5 and how this differs from the HTML systems that we have learned about in earliler chapters. In this we learn how this works with CSS in a cleaner way that highlights the elements that are highlited in CSS without the messy <div> groupings. Because this is an update from the HTML there are steps that need to be taken so that it may be read in older browsers. I did not quite understand the linking to JavaScript so that it can be read in certain older browsers, but if I decided to use HTML5 to create my webpage, I would possibly look more into this. However, when looking over the webpage example, it was much cleaner with the <hgroups> than with the multiple <div> tags to highlight elements, and I like that when you use the <figure> tag it can be inserted anywhere on the page, and not just where it placed. I also found the lack of the <content> tag to be interesting, and how the <header> and <footer> tags indicate where the main content is. I think that using HTML5 would help you focus on page elements more than having to organize where you content is, which would be nice if you have graphic heavy webpage. 

***Project Proposal***

For my project proposal I would like to historicize Java. Because of Java, there is an expectation of digital devices to be smarter, more functional, and way more entertaining. I think that this technology is important because amount of web systems are created using Java. Today Java is a commonly used foundation for developing and delivering content on the Web. According to Oracle, there are more than 9 million Java developers worldwide and more than 3 billion mobile phones run Java.
I understand that it is still a fairly newer markup language, coming about in the 1990's but its influence is vast and undeniable and I would like to explore the integration of Java and how it became the langauage of the web. It is sch an interesting system because it ha the ability to run on any computer ystem depsit its architecture. The fact that it was developed and implemented so quickly, makes me want to explore its internet domination. I want to exlpore where it was developed from and what prior markup langauges most inspired the creation of Java. I feel as though there is a slew of politics and power struggle that accompanied the creation and implementation of Java. 

The more research that I do on this markup language the more fascinated I become with the politcs of what happened to it after its creation, who owned the language and how it was marketed and distributed to other programmers and software companies.
