## Haas Summary

Haas refers to Vygotsky as she states that "writing is a psychological tool that provides the mediational means for certain kinds of thought" (pg. ). These tools are social, in that human beings appropriate them according to their surrounding culture. In order to understand these tools, we must first understand their history. She also mentions that there are two ways to think of history regarding computer writing tools. The first is that writing technologies are built from layers of other technologies. The second way is considering the technologies as products of human design decisions. Haas discusses factors such as power and politics, matters of timing and cost, and theories about software design affecting the overall design of these technology tools, and she applies these factors in a study she took part in regarding the scroll bar and menus in the Anderson computing system.
