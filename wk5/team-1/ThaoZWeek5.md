## Haas Summary

Haas refers to Vygotsky as she states that "writing is a psychological tool that provides the mediational means for certain kinds of thought" (pg. 138). These tools are social, in that human beings appropriate them according to their surrounding culture. In order to understand these tools, we must first understand their history. She also mentions that there are two ways to think of history regarding computer writing tools. The first is that writing technologies are built from layers of other technologies. The second way is considering the technologies as products of human design decisions. Haas discusses factors such as power and politics, matters of timing and cost, and theories about software design affecting the overall design of these technology tools, and she applies these factors in a study she took part in regarding the scroll bar and menus in the Anderson computing system. 

## HTML5

HTML5 introduces new elements that help define the structure of a webpage, but are not very compatible with older browsers. Ducket compares HTML5 to the traditional layouts, noting the use of _div_ versus separate elements in HTML5 and their purpose. He also discusses the new elements of HTML5, and advises CSS coding to render them in older browsers, as well as Javascript to style the elements in older browsers.

## Historicizing Project

At first, I thought about doing my project on buttons; how buttons functioned adn were designed intrigued me when I first began learning web design. However, it was hard finding resources pertaining to the implementation of buttons in web design. 

As I've always been interested in improving my own skills regarding CSS, I'm considering doing my project on CSS reset style. As I am also taking a visual design class, style sheets for web pages are of interest as you have to consider the rhetorical situation of a web page when you create style sheets. Of course, this means that I will also be discussing other ways of creating a structure for web pages, such as in-line coding.
