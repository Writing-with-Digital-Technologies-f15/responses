## Summary
### “Social Dynamics, or Scientific Truth, or Sheer Human Cussedness: Design decisions in the Evolution of a User Interface” – _Haas, Christina_ (1996)

Haas begins the chapter by reiterating, “writing is a psychological tool that provides the meditational means for certain kinds of thought,” which we discussed earlier when reading about her thoughts on Vygotskian framework (138). She references Vygotsky’s The Instrumental Method in Psychology where Vygotsky states that humans appropriate psychological tools based on their environment. The chapter highlights the importance of the history behind writing technologies, specifically computer literacy technologies and how they are “built upon the Roman alphabet” and “conventional notions of directionality and form that come from print, and even manuscript, technologies” (Haas 139).  Haas quotes Nathaniel Borenstein who says that “any well-designed computer system should be ‘so well suited to its intended use that the end user will never once stop to think about’ those who designed it” (139). I think this quote wraps up the thought process behind the creation of computer literacy technologies, but as Haas mentions can also mask the creator’s intent and the history of the creation.  

Haas focuses on two specific features of a computer system, the scrollbar and menus. Every computer feature is an end result of a series of highly complex decisions based on politics, history, logistical concerns, and implicit theories about how the given feature should work, taking in to account what a typical person may need to do with the feature (140). Haas was a consultant on the Andrew Project, which was a collaboration to develop and deploy a prototype educational computing system for Carnegie Mellon University.  She uses this project in her chapter to portray how difficult and complex just one feature of a computer system is.   Within the UIG, User Interface Group, user advocates became involved in user testing in which they came up with an endless list of complaints (146). The changes in the scroll bar were because of the user advocates. The majority of the member of the ITC did not see many problems with it because they had created it and worked with it. The scrollbar was hard to use for novice users and a small group of members in the UIG began redesigning it (151). When word got out the scroll bar was being redesigned, a number of rival scroll bar designs came out (152). The final design of the scrollbar was based on a designer’s individual belief in that customization is not always necessary. He broke away from the “free market” (153). Haas does the same in-depth look at the standardization of menus. The original end result design of the stack of cards menu was replaced with left-stacking menus. Some designers were disinclined to switch to the new system. This goes back to how new technology does not flat out replace old technology and new technology is not always “better” than old technology it is just different. It is not a simple process to replace the old menu design and the individual designer does not always get a say in the matter. The decision to change to the new design stemmed from the leader of the UIG (162).

I think the importance of the historicizing project in relation to Haas has to do with the inevitableness of computer literacy technology. It is easy to write off a computer feature and say that it was “inevitable” that the feature would look and function the way it does. To do this would be undermining the years of work many people have put in to making the feature the way it is. It is too easy to say that that the feature is at its best design without knowing anything about the history of the feature.  Though they had too many complaints to count, the director of ITC created a “wish list” of the top complaints they wanted fixed. 

## HTML 5
Duckett begins chapter 17 of _HTML & CSS_ with a comparison of traditional HTML layouts versus new HTML5 layouts. The difference being that instead of giving each section of the page its on ‘<div>’ element, the different sections are labeled more appropriately towards their function within the structure of the page layout (431,432). Duckett explains that older browsers treat HTML5 elements as inline elements. To help older browsers understand HTML5, Duckett inserts a line of CSS that should be included which helps render the correct elements. He also mentions in order to style the HTML5 elements in an older browser you have to use JavaScript. The JavaScript is known as HTML5 shiv or HTML5 shim and requires that anyone using a browser older than IE8 needs to make sure JavaScript is enabled in their browser (442). I think the implication of this is that newer is not always better. The fact that there are even workarounds for HTML5 in older browsers shows that some people still favor older browsers over the new but may want newer elements in their browsers. 


## Historicizing Project
For my historicizing project I am interested in looking into either vh and vw or vmin and vmax. After the lesson on responsive versus adaptive web pages, I thought these elements could have also been something to look deeper into. Since CSS width is correlated with the nearest containing parent element, the fact that vw is relative to the width of the viewport instead creates some different customization options. There is simplicity to using vh and vw for creating full-height/full-width with just a single line of CSS. The vmin and vmax are also relative to the viewport height and width. The responsive web-page value of these elements is inviting to use them. It is easy to create an element that on a web page that continuously touches both side of the screen by using setting the height and width within that element to a vmin value of 100. It is also possible to have a square box that completely covers the screen, touching all four sides. This is achieved through the vmax.  I would like to look more closely at the positives and drawbacks of using vmax/vmin and vh/vw. One thing I found out was that IE9 uses vm instead of vmin and does not support vmax. Another issue is that when building a full-width square grid using vw and vh units, the items will overflow the viewport.  I also want to look at the different uses of vmin/vmax and vh/vw. One source I looked at said font-size would be the obvious use for them, but other sources did not even mention using them for font-size. I am wondering what is the most popular use. One source I looked at went as far as saying there was no real purpose in the vmin and vmax, just in the vm and vh.
