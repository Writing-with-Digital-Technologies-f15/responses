## Haas Chapter 6 Summary
Continuing from her earlier writing, Haas works to dispel cultural myths of technology that hinder insightful and meaningful academic discourse on the topic. She outlines two of these notions: there is the belief of technological determinism, which presents technology as an unknowable, all-powerful force whose development and improvement is inevitable, and there is the “transparency” of technological features such as the computer interface. Haas argues that a well-designed computer interface that causes no strain on the participant to use and how natural that feels “may suggest an inevitability that masks the human decisions that have created the artifact.” (Haas, 1995, p. 139) To illustrate how these notions of technology are unfounded, Haas uses the Andrew Project, a planned educational computing system for Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980’s, and the story of its development as a case study.

Throughout her study, Haas makes it clear that each step in the Andrew Project’s development happened because people- a team of computer scientists, engineers, writers, human factors researchers, graphic designers and social scientists- worked on it and made decisions on how it should work. Contrary to technological deterministic beliefs, Haas shows that the Andrew Project didn’t build itself. Many people had to get together to bring the project from an idea to a completed, working system. Human agency shaped the Andrew project, not the other way around.

Haas also goes in-depth on how two features of the Andrew system’s interface developed: the scroll bar and the menu layout. On the topic of the scroll bar, apparently the development team had some heated arguments on how to implement it, given that Haas and even an observer at the time refer to this phase as the “scroll bar wars.” Controversy welled up between user advocates that were unfamiliar with the Andrew scroll bar and felt it wasn’t intuitive, and the members of the Information Technology Center (ITC), who were well-accustomed to the unique scroll bar. This escalated when ITC members realized that the User Interface Group (UIG) had approved and selected the user-advocate favored scroll bar to implement into the Andrew system. These members responded by submitting a large number of their own scroll bar designs and inciting debate on how the scroll bar should look and function. In the end the developer who implemented the scroll bar combined features from several submitted designs into one final scroll bar and, to end the debates once and for all, uninstalled all other scroll bars from the system, leaving only the final design. 

Haas uses this specific story to disprove that second cultural myth, that technology is “transparent” in its development, and I believe it does a good job of that. This myth believes that the only factors at play in a technological artifact are its functions and features, and the best of these will win out. The scroll bar wars, by contrast, show that a great deal of human politics guided the development of the final scroll bar, factors such as “power…, matters of timing and cost, and rival theories about software design.” (Haas, 1995, p. 163)

## HTML5 and Older Browsers
Duckett explains in Chapter 17 of HTML & CSS that older browsers don’t work well with the new elements made for HTML5, explaining that they will render that HTML as inline elements. Bypassing this requires some CSS tricks that tell the browser to render those elements as block-level, causing them to function correctly. This workaround only works for browsers after IE9, and earlier browsers must turn to a special JavaScript file to handle HTML5 properly. As for what implications this has, I think this scenario shows how dedicated people can be towards an artifact or system they prefer, or how clever people can be when they want to avoid making a change. I mean, I would think that when developers release a new build of a web browser, they make it a strict improvement over the older version, leaving that older version obsolete and with little reason to not upgrade. And yet, someone had to discover or even build this CSS workaround or the JavaScript that lets a user enjoy newer features like HTML5 support on older browsers. The desire for something old and cherised wins out over a desire for the latest and best, which ties back neatly with the Haas reading from earlier in the semester, which asserted that context is important for defining technological artifacts and newer doesn't always mean improved. For example, if a newest version of some software drops support for a function and I consider that function important, the newest version is then certainly not a strict improvement over the older version for me.

## Historicizing Project Ideas
For the historicizing project, I have been considering researching the ‘canvas’ element recently added in HTML5. This element “can be used to draw graphics via scripting in JavaScript. For example, it can be used to draw graphs, make photo compositions, create animations or even do real-time video processing or rendering.” (Mozilla Developer Network) Specifically, I will analyze the role the ‘canvas’ element plays in the creation of web browser-based games and the practices in this field surrounding its use. An example of values or knowledge tied to the ‘canvas’ element in game creation is how to use the graphics and animations rendering feature of that element to design a good, challenging course in a platformer-genre game. I could research how ideas of good level design differ between two separate browser game developers, or even how browser games as a whole compare to larger console releases.

I am also considering research into the ‘a’ element commonly used to form links. Given that links are what make web browsing and the whole concept of the internet as we see it today work, I think there ought to be a very rich history surrounding the HTML element that makes it possible. I could search for practices surrounding ‘a’s use for linking CSS files and other documents within a website and when it makes the most sense to use an in-house link as opposed to linking an outside source or document, for example. Or, I can look into the values and ethics of citing sources and how ‘a’ facilitates the fact-checking process.
