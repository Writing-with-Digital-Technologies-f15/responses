## Social Dynamics, or Scientific Truth, or Sheer Human Cussedness: Design Decision in the Evolution of a User Interface by Christina Haas 

In this chapter, Hass argues that evolution in technology is not “inevitable or self-determining” but that they are driven by human factors—such as stubbornness (137).  She focuses on dispelling the concept that the development of natural, easy to use operating systems and computer interfaces was inevitable through walking the reader through the Andrew Project, a development project that took place at Carnegie Mellon University over thirty years ago 

Haas uses the Andrew Project to show that development of key features, namely the scroll bar and menu, evolved as the result of human decision and action. She discusses the numerous arguments that individuals had over the intuitivity, or lack thereof, in the scroll bar. The arguments ultimately ended with a compromised design between intuitive and traditional scroll bars. 

The main argument of Vygotsky’s framework is that social interaction has a crucial role in the development of cognition. Haas builds off of this framework through discussing how the social dynamics of the working groups for the Andrew Project came together. One key example of this is seen in the “scroll bar wars” and is referenced by Haas as an intragroup power struggle and  a piece of supporting evidence for her argument (163).

I’ve always been taught that in writing anything my reader should never be left with the question “so what”. Once again, I am left with the question of “so what?” after reading Haas’ piece. I do not understand why Haas felt a call to write this. I am not trying to be combative—-I am just trying to find the value in this. Please, feel free to comment and educate me on what exactly it is that is so novel about stating that technological improvements are shaped by human decisions and are not inevitable.

## HTML 5 and Older Browsers

Duckett details the difference between HTML 5 and older web layouts.  One of the largest and most impactful differences between HTML and traditional layouts is the use of elements. Older browsers are unable to read new elements because they are accustomed to div elements and id attributes; this obviously complicated web browsing for developers. To avoid issues, developers needed to use CSS to bridge the translation gap and in some cases also needed to use HTML shiv/ HTML shim (442). Haas would probably enjoy this and sees this as an example of new technology not being inherently better than the old and human agency driving the change to create adaptations to HTML 5 so it’s functional on old systems; which of course is all lovely, but personally I see it more as computers are durable goods and the internet can’t press pause on the evolution button while Steve Somebody upgrades from his older browsing system. 

## Historicizing Project Ideas

I would like to historicize the use of **hexadecimal color codes in CSS and HTML**.  
I found [this source](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/) from W3C. It is a editor’s draft of a specification for CSS color values and properties in CSS level 4.  I  also found [another source](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/) from the W3C that is a few years older and acts as a spefication for color values and proprities in CSS level 2.  In doing some preliminary research into this, I found [this article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/the-code-side-of-color/)  in _Smashing Magazine_ on “The Code Side of Color”. It’s a really interesting read and also gave me some ideas of additional things to look into in the context of hexadecimal colors. 

As a secondary option, I could research the **history of GIF vs. PNG files**.  I found a view documents on the W3C site on GIF’s and PNG files (listed below). This introduced me to the **LZW compression** method, which is another topic I am interested in historicizing. The LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) method is a lossless data compression algorithm thats patent expired in 2003. The LZW is mainly used to compress GIF files.  This may be interesting to research in conjunction with the GIF vs. PNG debate.
