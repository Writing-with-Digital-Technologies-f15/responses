## Haas Chapter

In Haas’ article, she does a great job of showing how some technologies that are so ubiquitous in our culture as to be almost transparent, are nonetheless often a product of intense debate and begrudged collaboration among interested parties.  The menu function in the Andrew project itself had two specific incarnations, of which only one could be made official, and it took the director of the UIG to make the final decision.  Even having made a decision, and for reasons not everyone might have approved of, he had to couch the reasoning for it in language that was more acceptable to everyone. Some of the decisions came down to functionality vs. design aesthetics.  And as often as not, we found out, whichever interface testers used first tended to be their favorite.  But there were political factors, too.  Haas writes, “On their own, the user advocates…would have had little power to effect change, given their low status in the ITC” (163).  This should not be surprising, either, but it does feel like many of those creating the new technologies and making decisions didn’t themselves always know which one was the most usable.  

Case in point, a redesign of “the Scroll Bar Wars” might have been set into motion on advice of some of these user advocates, and that might have been a point of contention for those more “on the inside”.  Haas says “most of the members of the ITC, having used no other scroll bar, ‘basically thought it was fine’…” (151).  And since these members were more educated, and more heavily involved with the project, they may have been threatened by an outside idea threatening their ecosystem.  The re-vamp of it even started as part of the “Wish List” the user advocate groups were allowed, so as to streamline their seemingly constant demands.  The ensuing fighting over how it was designed was so drawn out that it seems hard for the Haas to even get a clear picture of whose idea was whose and which one had more backing at any one time.  This was probably made more difficult by how minor some of the tweaks to the design were admitted to be.  As such, one would probably think that the issues were less about actual functionality and efficiency as much as they were just for triumph.  When the director chose one, and it seemed to displease the experts that they could no longer change their scroll bars, it seemed a win for the user advocates.

Just to make sure that I discuss Vygotsky’s mediational means, what I've refered to already as the political and social interactions of the IUG attest to what he says about how technologies come about. It is of course not simply the most efficient end-point we get to for which a tech was pre-destined, and the progress of each one is never linear, as we can see in the difficulty this project had with deciding seemingly minor interface features.
    
##HTML5	
For me it is somewhat frustrating that Duckett mostly discusses how the HTML5 features may or may not work in some given version of Internet Explorer or other.  Didn’t I see somewhere that Chrome is now the top browser in more countries by far than any other...?  Regardless, I suppose the statements he makes about IE could also apply to older versions of my browser of choice. The main lesson I gleaned from Duckett about how HTML5 affects the rendering is that since some new block elements in the language may be rendered as in-line elements in older browsers, it’s up to you to add some CSS coding in the header which will prevent this from happening.  The boilerplate docs assured me, however, of just how important the head of the document is.  Not only is there a security requirement that the charset be present in the first 1024 bytes, it has a workaround to prevent older IE versions from not render your page in something other than the latest such engine they have available, as they are wont to do.  Again, this (makes my head hurt and) makes me glad I use Chrome.  Polyfills are an area I would consider historicizing, because with as much as I consume links to media on webpages (and have even tried to add them to others), the code is a feature which has probably affected me more than I know.

##Historicizing Project
Having worked with programs such as Paint since my parents had Windows 3.2, hearing about how the colors in web coding are mapped out really struck a chord with me.  I’m interested in, and already finding a little bit about what different ways colors are coded into CSS, why they are coded that way, and what other possibilities could be.

I also have for a long time had an affinity for fonts.  I like using different ones when possible to give off a different style or atmosphere.  I am curious how it has been decided which fonts are defaults, which ones got chosen first in browsers, and how that affects which ones are most used now.
    
I.	To be able to use a color in a piece of text or on a background, you need to first know where you want to use it.  You also need to be able to name the color something.  And I would think you are also thinking about which other colors you might use with this first color.  Having an idea about how colors look together is a skill that might be overlooked by some designers.  There were probably colors, or color schemes seen by the society at the time as more important than others, which may have given them an advantage in being coded.  This is also something which could have itself affect which methods are used to code colors.

As far as font styles, there is a skill in knowing one from another, and what those are used for.  There is already a canon of fonts which get play from word processors and which we see more than others in wide-circulation print media as well as online already.  In some cases, simply a font having been around longer could influence its use over another.
    
II.	I’m interested in finding out more about some of the best stories involving colors.  We talked a little in class about “rebeccapurple” and that’s a very specific example of how colors even get their names.  I’m sure there are newer colors besides that one which have stories behind how they are named the way they are.  And I am curious in what ways some of them are mostly coded, whether it is by a word tag or rbg.

As far as fonts, I would be curious to find out how different languages affect the font selection, how the fonts for those languages and alphabets are assigned, and how many there even are of those.
