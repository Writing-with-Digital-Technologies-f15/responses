_Social Dynamics, or Scientific Truth, or Sheer Human Cussedness: Design Decisions in the Evolution of a User Interface by Christina Haas_

In a summary, Haas argues that certain features of technology are due to human factors, like social dynamics and cussedness, the stubbornness of individuals involved (p. 137). She uses Vygotsky’s framework to support her argument that computer writing systems are the way they are based on politics, history, theories, and decisions made in a social setting (p. 140). She looks at the history of the scroll bar and the menu, focusing on the user interface design aspects of these two, to examine how decisions were made and how it affected the redesign process of the scroll bar and menu. 

Coming up with solutions to redesign the scroll bar and the menu were chaotic and problematic. The UIG couldn’t come to an agreement at all about what to do. In the case of the scroll bar, a small committee within the UIG was created to redesign the scroll bar. This resulted in many other versions being formed. Haas’ main point was the different versions of scroll bars presented did not really vary in design at all. The issue came from the unclear political position of the user advocates. The user advocates were seen as consultants, not as helpers in the actual design process, but were relegated to designers once a higher profile leader supported them. Aside from politics and institutional history, Haas also shows that changes can be made according to an individual’s own beliefs. Take for one, the designer who created the final version of the scroll bar, who opted out of using customization (p. 153).

As for the redesign of the menu, many issues the designers encountered were its inflexibility, pointing-finger cursor, and the space the menu took up (p. 158). Suggested changes made, Haas’ argues, revealed the conflicts between trying to balance programming principles and user-oriented designs (automaticity) (p. 159). Many of the designers were reluctant to make the suggested changes because it would limit functions they used mostly, such as being able to use the menus and submenus. Others thought white space was unnecessary (p. 160). Eventually, however, the stack of cards menu was adopted. 

Changes were made to the menus again when left-stacking menus were revealed. A small study conducted by Haas showed that using the new menus were more advantageous than the stack of cards menu although many of the users preferred the original, stack of cards. The leader of the UIG made the final decision to implement the new menu. 

Using Vygotsky’s framework, Haas looked at the history of the scroll bar and the menu and analyzed how social dynamics within a setting made the design process very complicated. A great quote from Haas that I think describes her argument is “the kinds of political concerns that motivate the construction of a computer system may well influence the construction of its history as well” (p. 144). The complex political situation the designers found themselves in resulted in how the scroll bars and menus turned out.

_HTML5 and Old Browsers_

Duckett explains how HTML5 layouts are different from traditional layouts. HTML5 uses elements instead of the div element and id attributes. Older browsers won’t be able to recognize the new elements (section, header, navigation elements) and will treat elements as inline elements. To counter this, CSS will have to be used to declare the new elements to be treated as block-level elements. Duckett also explains that if we are using older versions of Internet Explorer, since IE9 is the latest version to allow CSS to be used with new HTML5 elements, JavaScript known as HTML5 shiv or HTML5 shim will have to be used (p. 442).


##Historicizing Pitch

I am interested in researching either .gifs or heading tags. I think GIFs would be an interesting topic to pursue because of its popularity. I would be interested in looking into its history and how it came to be. 

Here are some sources I found to be of interest:

[GIF or PNG?](http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/png-gif)

[Facebook starts supporting animated GIFs](http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2015/06/01/facebook-starts-supporting-animated-gifs/)

[How to use heading tags for SEO](http://blog.woorank.com/2013/04/how-to-use-heading-tags-for-seo/)


###What practices are linked to this technology: tools, community knowledge and values, and skills?

.gifs are probably most known for its ability to animate images, something that .png and .jpeg are not able to do. 

The heading tags provide structure and organization for a website. Similar to what you would see within printed media, headings are used to provide context to a larger piece of information. Headings can make it easier to browse and find information, also benefitting usability. 

###What competing issues or trends are you interested in investigating and why?

I would be interested in looking into GIFs have become so popularized in our social culture. I found an article from Forbes that discussed how Facebook just recently started to support animated GIFs. This also supports just how popular GIFs have become, especially on social media platforms.

For the heading tags, I would be interested in looking into how it affects search engine optimization (SEO). I didn't know that header tags affect SEO and I think it would be interesting to see just how headers affect it. I also think it would be interesting to look into how it affects usability.
