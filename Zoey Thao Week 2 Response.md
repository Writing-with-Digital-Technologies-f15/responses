### The Science of Handwriting

Brandon Keim (2013) notes that handwriting unifies our hands, eyes, and attention at a single point in space and time. Reading the letters we penned activates the neurological instructions for penning it. Keim references to Karin James when he mentions that seeing handwritten letters heightens activity in visual areas as well as triggering the expected motor activity writing it. He sees writing as an ever shifting interplay between knowledge and our thoughts.

### On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies

Christina Haas (1999) introduces two models in regards to old and new technologies. The first one is the simple replacement model, which assumes that there is a clear difference between the old and the new technologies, and that new technologies simply replace the older ones theoretically and in practice. The second model is the straightforward progress model, where new technologies are more advanced and efficient, and powerful, thus producing the view that new is better. In studying technology historically, Haas notes that technology cannot simply replace one over the other as technology is closely anchored to both individual histories and cultural practices. She refers to the Vygotskian approach in studying technology: multiple technologies for literacy exists, history-of-use is complex and overlapping, and technology's uses are tied intrinsically to other human activities (pg. 213).

Haas referred to three case studies regarding literacy technologies and the practice of work. She made three observations: competing visions of what technology is and what it can do are operative in contemporary workplaces, multiple literacy technologies are co-present in the conduct of work, and advanced literacy technologies are not necessarily the most powerful within work cultures. The first case study was an observation of a single city engineer and his work to manage utilities and infrastructures in Ashton, a small city located in northeast Ohio. Through this case study, it was noted that there was a clear understanding about the appropriateness of specific communication technologies for specific tasks among the engineer, his staff, and other engineers. The second case study was about Ashton's government implementing new electronic communications. However, it was met with negativity as one administrative assitant did not see any poblems with teh current system, and an assistant city manager believed the idea would not find popular support among the citizens of Ashton. Haas concludes with this case study that the "failed vision of technological change illustrates importance of individuals' conceptions of technologies and shows how, even in organization, that works rather well adn among workers who work closely with one another, profound disjunctions about what technology _is_ are present" (pg. 218). In the third case study, observations are made on the uses of the documents in an abortion clinic, where Haas notes that old and new technologies coexist. She specifically refers to the blue sheet used to gather informtion about patients; it was originally produced by a typewriter, is photocopied, and then filled in by hand by clinic personnel. 

Haas refers to Bijker as she attempts to help understand the three case studies of technology being used in the practice of work. She notes that some aspects of technology must remain constant for users to have a reference to in order to understand or use them. She also mentions that decisions about technology are contrained by surrounding historical, material, and cultural circumstances, whether the technology is being developed or used.

### Grids and CSS

Bradley Dilger (2010) mainly focused on an international style in _<table>ing the Grid_, which he quoted Jan Middendorp as an attempt to "obtain maximum aesthetic effect by the simplest means: black and white photography, unjustified, homongeneous blocks of sanserif text, a conscious use of white space as a compositional element and the grid as a guiding principle" (pg. 215). 

Patrick Brosset (2015) believes the goal of a grid is to serve as a base for Web content to stay aligned and evenly spaced, mentioned in his post titled "The future of layout with CSS: Grid layouts." CSS makes it possible to define the grids for Web content to go into, allowing for optimized design without compromising the ability to manipulate content.
