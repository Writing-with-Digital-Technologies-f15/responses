_The Science of Handwriting_ by Brandon Keim
Keim explores the connections between writing by hand vs. machine and the creative thought process. The article discusses the relationship between forming letters by hand and improved spatial thinking and reading comprehension and comes to the conclusion that, while studies still need to be duplicated, there is a definite correlation between handwriting and things like spelling, reading comphrehension, and retention of notes jotted down by hand. 

Brosset, Patrick. (26 Aug. 2015). The future of layout with CSS: Grid layouts. Medium.com. Retrieved 03 Sep. 2015 from https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/css-grid-layout-6c9cba6e8a5a.

In this piece, Brosset outlines the key features of CSS and explains the concepts of grid and how the grid allows for site to easily adapt to mobile devices and other devies beyond traditional computers. He describes what  a responsive grid is and gives examples of ways that CSS grids work on sites. Brosset also explains that CSS works as a tool for increasing site simplicity and maintainability.

Haas, Christina. (1999). On the relationship between old and new technologies. Computers & Composition, 16, pp. 209-228. PDF copy.

In _On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies_, Christina Haas explores the aforementioned connections through a lens influenced by the theories of Lev Vygotsky. The paper is driven by an interest in debasing the assumption that old and new technologies are different from each other (improve over time) and that newer technologies are more efficient and effective.

Dilger, Bradley. (2010). <table>ing the grid: In B. Dilger & J. Rice (Eds.), From a to <a>: Keywords of markup, (pp. 213-227). Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press

In _<table>ing the grid,_ Dilger discusses the history of the table markup function and demonstrates the breadth of its influence and use. He discusses the tool's appropriations by graph designers are a design tool and how <table> has improved page simplicity. This use paved the way for the development of CSS and the fucntions were eventually rendered virtually defunct by the CSS grid system

### Connections:
 Right away, I can draw a clear connection between Dilger's and Brosset's pieces. While Dilger's piece talks about the beginnings of a grid layout on screen via the <table> function and ultimately moves to discuss the essential replacement of the function with CSS's grid system, Brosset's article is devoted to CSS' grids. This can also be viewed as an example of old and new technologies and can bring Haas' piece into the conversation. Is the CSS grid better or more effective than the table? Or is it just new? Drawing further from Haas' piece, we can connect to Keim's ideas on handwriting and the thought process. Is the new, "improved" way to write really better than traditional handwriting? Why?
